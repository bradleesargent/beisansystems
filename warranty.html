<p class="style1">Beisan Systems &ndash; Limited 90 day warranty</p>
<p>  Beisan Systems, LLC makes every effort to assure that its  products meet high quality and durability standards, and warrants to the  original purchaser that this product is free from defects in materials and  workmanship for the period of 90 days from the date of purchase. This warranty  does not apply to damage due directly or indirectly, to misuse, abuse, negligence  or accidents, repairs or alterations outside our facilities, or to lack of  maintenance. We shall  in no event be liable for death, injuries to persons  or property, or for incidental, contingent, special or consequential damages  arising from the use of our product. Some states do not allow the exclusion or  limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation of  exclusion may not apply to you. This warranty is expressly in lieu of all other  warranties, express or implied, including the warranties of merchantability and  fitness.<br />
  <br />
To take advantage of this warranty, the product or part must  be returned to us with transportation charges prepaid. Proof of purchase date  and an explanation of the complaint must accompany the merchandise. If our  inspection verifies the defect, we will either repair or replace the product at  our election or we may elect to refund the purchase price if we can not readily  and quickly provide you with a replacement. We will return repaired products at  our expense, but if we determine there is no defect, or that the defect  resulted from causes not within the scope of our warranty, then you must bear  the cost of returning the product.<br />
  <br />
This warranty gives you specific legal rights and you may  also have other rights which vary from state to state.<br />
