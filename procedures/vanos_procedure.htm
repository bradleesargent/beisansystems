  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Introduction</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>"Vanos" is BMW's name for its variable valve timing units.
    Vanos units take on various shapes and design according to car year and model
    (engine model). The vanos discussed here is BMW part # 11-36-1-440-142. It's a double
    vanos; meaning both the intake and exhaust valve timing is varied. This vanos
    unit is part of BMW 6-cylinder engines M52TU, M54, and M56. These engines were incorporated
    into a wide range of car models during years 1998-2006. They are found in the 3-series
    E46 98-05, 5-series E39 99-03 / E60 &amp; E61 02-05, 7-series E38 98-01 / E65
    &amp; E66 02-05, Z3 E36 98-02, Z4 E85 02-05, X3 E83 03-06, X5 E53 00-06.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>This vanos has been experiencing a failure. It has been
    diagnosed that the failure is due to deterioration of the vanos piston seal
    O-rings. It has been determined that these O-rings are made from Buna (Buna-N,
    NBR, Nitrile). Buna is a very common O-ring material, but is limited in its
    temperature and chemical resistance characteristics. Unfortunately it is
    fairing quite badly in the vanos/engine environment. The O-rings have been
    found to harden, shrink, and have flat surfaces. This deterioration is causing
    the O-rings to lose their functional characteristics and thus cause the vanos
    to fail. BMW has been engaged regarding this matter, but has elected to not
    address the issue, "No further development will be done". New (rebuilt) vanos
    units are being sold with the same Buna O-rings. BMW does not provide the vanos
    piston seals/O-rings as a separate part.<br>
    Here is a link to the Roadfly BMW E39 forum where much of this information was
    first made public: <a
href="http://bimmer.roadfly.com/bmw/forums/e39/7494631-2.html">http://bimmer.roadfly.com/bmw/forums/e39/7494631-2.html</a><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The piston O-rings lie under and provide support to piston
    Teflon seal rings. Replacing the O-rings requires removing the Teflon seals to
    access the O-rings. The Teflon seals can not be practically removed from the
    piston seal grooves without damaging them. Thus replacing the O-rings
    necessarily requires replacing the Teflon seals.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The Buna O-rings can be replaced with O-rings made from
    Viton. Viton (FKM, Fluorocarbon) has similar functional characteristics to
    Buna, but has much higher temperature and chemical resistance characteristics.
    It's also recommended for the automobile engine environment. The vanos Teflon
    (PTFE filled) seals are not a standard part and need to be semi-custom manufactured.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The vanos has two pistons with seals/O-rings. Each piston
    utilizes two seal/O-ring sizes to provide hydraulic sealing in two vanos cylinders
    of different sizes. Each piston also utilizes one further small O-ring. This
    O-ring mounts on a small cap that's used to seal off a piston bearing. The OEM
    O-ring for this cap seems to also be made from Buna and is deteriorating in the
    same manner as the piston seal O-rings.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>A vanos seals/O-rings repair kit can be acquired through
    Beisan Systems (bee-saan), <a href="http://www.beisansystems.com/products">www.beisansystems.com/products</a>.
    It includes a vanos replacement set of OEM material Teflon seals and enhanced (Viton)
    O-rings.<br>
    Here is a link to the Roadfly BMW E39 forum where the vanos seals product was first
    introduced: <a href="http://bimmer.roadfly.com/bmw/forums/e39/8705552-2.html">http://bimmer.roadfly.com/bmw/forums/e39/8705552-2.html</a><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Symptoms</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Cars experience:<br>
    Overall loss of torque and power, particularly in the lower RPM range, &lt; 3k.
    Bogging then surging at 3k RPM. Uneven power distribution and RPM transition.
    Engine hesitations in the lower RPM range, &lt; 3k. Louder idle and
    intermittent idle RPM hiccups. Difficult takeoffs. Loss of power and bogging
    when AC on. Increased fuel consumption.<br>
    Repairing the vanos seals provides:<br>
    Overall increase in torque and power, particularly in the lower RPM range, &lt;
    3k. Resolution of bogging then surging at 3k RPM. Smooth even distribution of
    power and RPM transition. Resolution of engine hesitations in the lower RPM
    range, &lt; 3k. Quiet stable idle. Smooth easy takeoffs. Improved performance
    when AC on. Reduced fuel consumption, by ~10%.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Cars with the M52TU engine (98/99-00) experience cold
    weather cold start idle jolts and possible stall.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>In some cases the engine computer will generate a fault
    code. The code is usually associated with the vanos exhaust side. This is due
    to the powerful spring in the vanos exhaust cylinder which forces the piston
    out. Fault codes include:<br>
    P1520 (BMW 104, 0x68): B (exhaust) Camshaft Position Actuator (faulty reference
    value).<br>
    P1523 (BMW 106, 0x6A): B (exhaust) Camshaft Position Actuator Tight or Jammed
    (mechanically stuck).<br>
    P1397 (BMW 18, 0x12): Camshaft Position Sensor B (exhaust) Circuit.<br>
    The exhaust camshaft position sensor (CPS) is a common failure. But if
    replacing the exhaust CPS (w/ OEM CPS) doesn't work then it's likely the vanos
    failure.<br>
    On 01+ M54 &amp; M56 engine cars codes P1520 &amp; P1523 were removed. Thus
    code P1397 appears.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Diagnosis</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>With M52TU engine cars (98/99-00) with cold engine idle jolt
    symptoms, the vanos intake solenoid (metal cylinder) electrical connector can
    be removed. If the idle jolts cease then the problem is the vanos seals.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>A vanos exhaust side fault code, as described above, is most
    likely a vanos seals failure indication.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Otherwise the vanos needs to be removed from the engine for
    inspection. Once the vanos cylinder covers are removed, an inspection of the
    piston seals fit in the cylinders will show a loose fit and thus a seals
    failure. Removal of the seals from the pistons will show the inner O-rings have
    flat spots and a loss of elasticity.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>In general, a diagnosis is not necessary. The vanos Buna
    O-rings are deteriorating in 20k miles (32k kilometers). Thus essentially all
    the cars with this vanos have deteriorated O-rings and a failing vanos.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Repair Procedure</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The following is an E46 &amp; E39 double vanos piston seals
    R&amp;R (remove and replace) procedure.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>If the valve cover gaskets are over 40k miles (64k
    kilometers) old, then it's prudent to replace them during this repair. If they
    are over 80k miles (128k kilometers) old, then it is a requirement to replace
    them during this repair, otherwise they might leak due to being dismounted and
    reused. These gaskets have an estimated lifespan of ~60k miles (96k kilometers)
    and replacing them during this repair requires no extra effort. The needed parts
    and replacement procedure are included as optional.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Repair time: 4 hours mechanic, 6+ hours DIY.<br>

    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Allow RTV sealant to dry a minimum of one hour before
    driving car.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>On first engine start after repair the engine can experience
    a couple engine hiccups at idle. This might be related to trapped air in the
    vanos.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Check and replenish engine oil.<br>
    Drive car, then park car and let engine oil settle.<br>
    Remove oil dipstick; wipe dipstick end; fully reinsert dipstick; remove
    dipstick again; read oil marking. If oil is low add needed (small) amount of
    new oil at oil fill cap at valve cover.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>E39: Check and replenish coolant.<br>
    When car is fully cold (morning) open coolant expansion tank and check coolant
    level. Measuring sick top should be at expansion tank cap rim. Fill coolant as
    needed.<br>
    Drive car until warm. Slightly open each bleed screw and allow air to escape
    (Philips). Close bleed screw when only fluid is escaping. There is a bleed
    screw at the coolant expansion tank and a bleed screw at the radiator upper
    hose.<br>
    Repeat fill and bleed procedure as needed to achieve proper coolant level.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>~200 miles (320 kilometers) of city driving is needed to
    fully break-in vanos seals and achieve optimum performance. Spirited driving
    will hasten break-in period. Initial improvements will be felt in the first few
    days of driving.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Please provide feedback on vanos forum after seals break-in
    period. <a href="http://www.beisansystems.com/forum.html">www.beisansystems.com/forum.html</a><br>
