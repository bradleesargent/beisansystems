    <br>
  </p>
  <p>One of the most wearable components of the E39 front
    suspension system is the thrust arm bushing. Its lifespan is approximately 60k
    "20k miles. The bushing is a fluid filled rubber cylinder wrapped in a metal
    sleeve. It sits inside the thrust arm bore and acts as a shock absorber. Over
    time and wear, the rubber tears and the fluid leaks out. This leaves behind a
    distinctive diagnostic indicator which presents as a spill mark on the bottom
    exterior of the bushing sleeve and thrust arm bore. The bushing needs to be
    replaced, although consideration should be given to replacing the complete
    thrust arm.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The following is a discussion on the thrust arm bushing
    failure symptoms and diagnosis, and an E39 R&amp;R (remove and replace)
    procedure.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Symptoms</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Intermittent steering wheel shimmy (side to side shaking) at
    a certain speed interval, usually 50-60 MPH. The shimmy can occur only when braking
    or only when not braking. The symptoms sometimes heighten in the morning before
    the tires warm up. Symptom nuance characteristics can also change if the
    suspension configuration is modified; Examples: tire pressure, tires, wheel
    balance, wheels, brakes, rotors, etc. Thus owners can be misled into perceiving
    the problem is resolved due to symptom changes caused by suspension adjustments.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Symptoms other than steering wheel shimmy can also occur:</p>
  <ol start=1 type=1>
    <li>Front tire inner tread wear and cupping.</li>
    <li>Intermittent front end clunk on stops and/or starts.</li>
    <li>ABS engagement during moderately heavy braking on rough
      pavement.</li>
    <li>Less responsive handling.</li>
    <li>Less responsive braking.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Unfortunately, the symptoms can be shared with other faulty
    suspension related components, like out of round rotors. Thus a proper
    diagnosis is important to identifying the failure.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Configuration Background</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Before discussing diagnoses, it"s helpful to have some understanding
    of the front suspension arm configuration.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>There are two front suspension arms, and they both
    incorporate a bushing. They are the Thrust Arm, and the Control Arm. BMW calls
    the thrust arm, Tension Strut on the E39 6-cylinder, and Traction Strut on the E39
    8-cylinder. The common name is Thrust Arm.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image001.jpg"><br>
    The front suspension arms are found at each front wheel. They both connect
    between the wheel carrier (ball joint) and the frame (bushing joint). They form
    a "triangle" between the wheel carrier and the frame. This triangle provides
    good symmetry for lateral and longitudinal suspension balance. The thrust arm is
    longer than the control arm. It takes on a steeper angle and rises higher to
    the frame, and thus is also called an Upper Control Arm. It handles much of the
    longitudinal (fore/aft) car jarring, and consequently takes on much abuse and
    wear. The control arm is shorter. It takes a smaller angle and rises less to
    the frame than the thrust arm, and thus is also called a Lower Control Arm. It
    handles much of the latitudinal (side to side) movement, and consequently takes
    on less load forces and lasts longer than the thrust arm.<br>
    On the 6-cyl (picture, left front), the thrust arm mounts on top of the wheel
    carrier shelf and heads to the front (picture right), and thus is also called a
    Leading Control Arm. The control arm mounts on bottom of the wheel carrier shelf
    and heads to the rear (picture left), and thus is also called a Trailing
    Control Arm.<br>
    On the 8-cyl, the two arms switch directions, and thus the thrust arm is a Trailing
    Control Arm and the control arm is a Leading Control Arm. They are both mounted
    on bottom of the wheel carrier shelf.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The bushing end of the thrust arm has a cylindrical bore
    that holds a bushing. The bushing is a rubber cylinder with an outer metal
    sleeve and an inner metal shaft. In recent BMW builds (E39 included), the
    bushing rubber is filled with hydraulic fluid. The bushing mounts inside the
    thrust arm bore and is held in place by pressure. The bushing outer diameter is
    slightly larger (~.3mm) than the thrust arm bore diameter, so once in position,
    the pressure of metal against metal holds it in place. The center shaft allows
    for a bolt to run through the bushing and mount the thrust arm to the frame.
    The bushing acts as a shock absorber during wheel movements.<br>
    Over time and wear the bushing rubber ends tear, allowing the inner fluid to
    leak out, and causing the bushing to fail.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The control arm bushing has a similar structure to the
    thrust arm bushing. It differs in that it"s built into the arm (one component),
    is fully rubber (not fluid filled), and is smaller in size. Like the thrust
    arm, it also acts as a shock absorber during wheel movements.<br>
    Over time and wear the bushing rubber dries, hardens, and then tears. This
    causes the bushing to fail.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The ball joint ends of both arms are the same. The arm end
    has a socket built in, and the mounting bolt morphs into a ball at the arm end.
    The ball diameter is larger than the socket rim diameter and thus the ball is permanently
    recessed into the socket. The ball fits snugly into the socket, leaving no room
    for "play". The joint is greased and encapsulated in a protective rubber boot.
    The ball joint allows joint rotation during wheel movements, while maintaining
    a tight connection between the arm and the wheel carrier.<br>
    The ball joint ball and socket matting surfaces deteriorate/shrink with use and
    wear and a space in the joint slowly develops. This space creates "play" in the
    suspension configuration thus changing its designed characteristics. The ball
    joint rubber boot can also tear, allowing the grease to leak out. This will
    cause friction in the ball joint and significantly increase joint wear. The rubber
    boot is not available separately and the ball joint will likely have
    encountered excessive wear, thus its replacement is not viable.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The third arm connected to the wheel carrier is the Outer
    Tie-rod Arm and is a component of the steering system. It has a ball joint at
    the wheel carrier and incorporates a horizontally positioned ball joint as part
    of the arm at the steering end. On the 6-cyl it mounts at the front bottom of
    the wheel carrier shelf. On the 8-cyl it mount at the rear bottom of the wheel
    carrier shelf.<br>
    The ball joints deteriorate and fail in the same manner as the suspension arm
    ball joints.<br>
    <br>
    <b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Diagnosis</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>A thrust arm bushing fails when a section of its rubber tears
    and its internal fluid leaks out. A failure diagnosis is attained by noting the
    rubber tear or the fluid leak.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>A bushing rubber tear can be inspected by prying (~18" pry
    bar) each bushing end away from the frame and looking for the tear. It is
    unfortunately difficult to get a clear view of the rubber ends while the
    bushing is mounted. Another approach is to disconnect the bushing from the
    frame. This will facilitate a clear view and inspection of the bushing rubber
    ends, but unfortunately the removal and remount of the bushing is somewhat
    involved. Some components need to be removed to allow room for removing the
    bushing bolt, and the car needs to be in "normal position" to perform the final
    mount tightening. The specifics of these procedures are covered in the repair
    section (below).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>A rubber tear can in some cases be at the sleeve side and
    not be visibly discernable. In such cases a fluid leak indication is necessary
    for denoting the failure.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Inspecting for a fluid spill is an easier diagnosis approach
    than looking for a rubber tear. When the fluid leaks out it leaves a fluid
    spill mark on the bottom exterior of the bushing sleeve and arm bore.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image002.jpg"><br>
    The 6-cyl has two cutouts in the engine compartment shield (under front of car)
    that allow for thrust arm bushing inspection. BMW engineers must have felt this
    was a wearable part and needed frequent inspection. The fluid spill mark can be
    easily seen through the cutout.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image003.jpg"><br>
    Taking off the engine compartment shield (Philips screwdriver) and then the plastic
    single side cover (10mm socket/driver) over the bushing joint, allows for a
    fuller inspection. With the protection covers off the distinctive spill mark can
    be easily denoted.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>On the 8-cyl, the thrust arm is a trailing arm (rear of
    front of car) and the bushing joint is exposed. This is a small determent to
    the diagnosis, since dirt can accumulate on the joint making the spill mark
    less obvious. Noting the spill mark on the bushing sleeve and the overall spill
    outline helps to clarify the image.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>If the bushing rubber tear is at the sleeve edge the fluid
    leak can be very slow and not cause a spill mark indication. In such cases
    noting a small active leak at a bushing end bottom is necessary for denoting
    the failure. Prying (~18 pry bar) the bushing at the sleeve might cause some
    remaining fluid to leak out.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Unfortunately in some cases a rubber tear, spill mark, or
    leak can not be denoted. In such cases the symptoms and the bushing lifespan
    might need to be depended on for the assessment.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Note: Checking the wheels and thrust arm for play does not
    produce an indication of thrust arm bushing failure. Prying (pry bar) at the
    bushing also does not produce a failure indication, as new and failed bushings
    can have seemingly equivalent movements. </p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image001.jpg"><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The thrust arm bushing can be replaced, but if the thrust
    arm ball joint is worn then both thrust arm and bushing should be replaced.
    Thus it"s important to assess the state of the thrust arm ball joint before
    proceeding with a repair.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>It is most effective to look for play in the thrust arm ball
    joint when the joint is disconnected from the wheel carrier. The bolt (ball)
    can be pushed in/out of the arm (socket) repetitively to detect any play (free
    space). Unfortunately dismounting the ball joint from the wheel carrier requires
    disconnecting the strut at the wheel carrier and a special tool to remove the
    ball joint bolt from the wheel carrier shelf.<br>
    The ball joint can be assessed while mounted but this takes some finesse and
    experience. The arm (socket) is pushed/pried on/off the bolt (ball) to look for
    play. A ~18" "pry bar" is an ideal tool for this task. On the 6-cyl, wedge the
    pry bar between the strut butt and ball joint head, to press the socket towards
    the ball, and between the wheel carrier shelf and the arm stem adjacent to the
    rubber boot, to expand the socket away from the ball. On the 8-cyl, utilize the
    shelf and arm stem for the expansion, and the wheel inner rim and ball joint head
    for the press. Play is denoted by a slight swift movement in response to a
    small amount of applied pressure. Smooth incremental movement due to increasing/decreasing
    pressure is due to ball joint rotation and does not denote free space.<br>
    A worn thrust arm ball joint causes a symptom of click/clunk sound on sudden
    suspension movement, such as car starts and stops.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The control arm bushing is also diagnosed by utilizing a ~18"
    pry bar. Markedly push the control arm end laterally to one side and then the
    other. Leverage the pry bar between the arm end and the frame at the bushing.
    Look for rubber tears. Also look for rubber resilience (spring); the arm end
    should bounce back when released.<br>
    A failed control arm bushing will produce similar symptoms to a failed thrust
    arm bushing.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The control arm ball joint is diagnosed in the same manner
    and has the same symptoms as the thrust arm ball joint.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The outer tie-rod wheel carrier ball joint can also be
    diagnosed in the same manner as the thrust arm and control arm ball joints.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>An overall system ball joint inspection can be performed by wheel
    manipulation. Play in any of the aforementioned ball joints can be engaged by
    maneuvering the wheel. The car front wheels will need to be off the ground to
    perform this inspection. Place one hand on the tire 12 o"clock inner shoulder,
    and the other hand on the wheel rim 6 o"clock outer lip. Engage your shoulder
    at the 12 o"clock end. Attempt to push in at the 6 o"clock position. Look for a
    quick small movement. This will indicate play (free space). Reposition hands
    and shoulder to leverage the wheel in the opposite direction." Place one hand
    on the tire 6 o"clock inner shoulder, and the other hand on the wheel rim 12
    o"clock outer lip. Engage your shoulder at the 6 o"clock end. Attempt to push
    in at the 12 o"clock position. Again, look for a quick small movement which
    will indicate play. Any play in either test direction indicates ball joint wear
    at the ball joints mounted on the wheel carrier shelf. Individual ball joint
    inspection is necessary to isolate the faulty ball joint(s).<br>
    Perform the same inspections as above but rotate the wheel from side to side, 3
    &amp; 9 o"clock. There will be an initial movement until the steering lock
    limit is reached. Otherwise the test is the same as above. Any play in these
    directions indicates outer tie-rod inner ball joint wear.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>A technique similar to the wheel manipulation scheme can be
    applied during an alignment procedure. The steering wheel can be turned to one
    side, and then the other. Any non proportional change in toe or camber numbers is
    an indication of a worn ball joint(s).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>A thrust arm bushing could be expected to last approximately
    60k "20k miles. A thrust arm ball joint could be expected to last the lifespan
    of two or three thrust arm bushings. A control arm could be expected to last
    the lifespan of two thrust arms (ball joint). These are very rough estimates,
    and individual experiences will vary significantly. Suspension wear is greatly
    influenced by road conditions and suspension balance. An out of round/balance
    tire/wheel can significantly increase wear on bushings and ball joints.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Repair Considerations</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The solution to a torn thrust arm bushing is to replace the
    bushing. The thrust arm bushing is an independent part and can be replaced separately.
    If the thrust arm ball joint is worn then the thrust arm needs to be replaced,
    as the ball joint is an integral part of the arm.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The following is a study of several thrust arm bushing
    repair approaches. These discussions will also implicitly address approaches to
    replacing the thrust arm (ball joint).<br>
    "</p>
  <p>BMW calls for replacing the thrust arm bushings in pairs. The
    bushings are sold in pairs.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><u>BMW Technique</u><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image004.jpg"><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>BMW"s approach to replacing the thrust arm bushing is to,
    disconnect the thrust arm from the car, utilize a hydraulic press to press out
    the old bushing and press in the new bushing, and then remount the arm. The
    bushing joint is mounted to the frame with a bolt and nut and can be
    disconnected with standard tools. The 6-cyl needs the brake air duct removed,
    and the 8-cyl needs the stabilizer bar mounts disconnected, to facilitate
    access and removal of the bushing mounting bolt. The ball joint bolt expands in
    a conical shape at its base and thus causes the forming of a tight bond between
    the bolt and wheel carrier shelf when mounted. A BMW special tool, part #
    99-88-6-31-2-240 (picture right), is needed to dislodge the bolt from the wheel
    carrier shelf. To remove the ball joint the strut (shock) needs to be loosened
    from the wheel carrier bearing and the wheel carrier lowered on the strut to
    facilitate needed space. To slide the wheel carrier down on the strut the wheel
    carrier bearing needs to be lubricated and expanded at the seam with a lever
    bar (large flathead). The wheel carrier bearing seam needs to be aligned to a
    strut mark when remounting. The mark is either found on a strut label (R &amp;
    L), or is drawn on the strut before dismounting.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>To press out/in the bushing from the thrust arm BMW has
    designed a set of press/receive sleeves (cylinders) to facilitate the press
    (picture, 6-cyl right, 8-cyl left). 6-cyl, part# 99-88-6-31-2-270, $22.63
    (includes 271 &amp; 272); 8-cyl part# 99-88-6-31-2-260, $37 (includes 261 &amp;
    263).</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image005.jpg"><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>A receive (lower) sleeve supports the thrust arm bore on its
    perimeter while facilitating room for a full bushing to recess into the sleeve.
    A press (upper) sleeve sits on the bushing metal sleeve inner rim and is pressed
    by the hydraulic press to insert the bushing through the thrust arm bore. The
    old bushing is pressed through completely, while the new bushing is pressed in
    to a center position in the arm bore.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Reinstalling the arm involves the extra wrinkle of
    tightening the bushing/frame bolt/nut while the car is in "normal position".
    This requires the car to be resting on its wheels on a level surface with a
    full tank of gas and weighed down with 500 lb in a specific configuration. Fortunately
    this can be achieved more practically by manipulating the suspension into the
    needed position.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The biggest complication of the BMW technique for a DIY job
    is the need for the hydraulic press. Although a hydraulic press can be acquired
    in an inexpensive ($150+) simple implementation (bottle jack and metal frame
    housing), its size and infrequent use make it impractical for the average
    DIYer. A local BMW dealership or indy shop could be hired to perform the press,
    but the logistics of accomplishing this in the middle of the repair are difficult
    and precarious. In addition to the hydraulic press obstacle, there"s also the
    added complexity of removing the ball joint so the arm can be taken to the
    hydraulic press. There"s also the cost of the BMW special tools.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><u>Complete Arm Replacement Technique</u><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>One often touted approach is to replace the complete thrust
    arm instead of just the bushing. This is usually combined with purchasing after
    market arms that have preinstalled bushings. New BMW OEM thrust arms do not
    have preinstalled bushings. OEM bushings are acquired separately and need to be
    installed. A BMW dealership or indy shop could be hired to perform the installation.
    The complete arm replacement approach alleviates the logistics of having the
    bushings pressed in/out by a mechanic during the repair process. The low cost
    of after market arms with preinstalled bushings lowers the cost overhead of
    replacing the complete arm.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><u>At Car Bushing Repair Technique</u><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>If the repair is to only replace the bushings, then BMW"s technique
    can be greatly simplified by avoiding two of its fundamental approaches. First,
    to not disconnect the ball joint since it"s not directly related to the
    problem. Second, to not utilize a hydraulic press, but to employ a smaller mobile
    press tool to perform the press at the car while the ball joint is still
    mounted.<br>
    This is not a unique approach. BMW utilizes this method on the E39 rear end
    bushing repairs. "The BMW tool sets for these cases employ a spindle (bolt)
    that runs through the bushing center shaft and facilitates a press cup and nut
    and receive cup to press in/out the bushing. This technique might not have been
    utilized by BMW on the thrust arm bushing due to the bushing"s large size and
    proportionally narrow center shaft; i.e. too much force on a small spindle.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>There are after market tool manufacturers that have produced
    tools to perform "at car" bushing presses. Below are two such tools for the
    thrust arm bushing.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>SIR Tools, Bushing Master Kit, part# BMW3021, $200, is a kit
    that addresses the various BMW model front control/track (thrust) arm bushings.
    Unfortunately the kit has not been updated to include the E39.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Technic Tool Supply, Trailing Arm Set, part# BMW38-39 +
    Zinko 8 ton hydraulic hand pump, $285 + $375, is a kit that specifically addresses
    the E39 &amp; E38 thrust arm bushings. The E38 and E39 8-cyl utilize the same thrust
    arm bushing. Unfortunately, the tool"s astronomical price makes it nonviable.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><u>Jaw Puller &amp; Pipe Cap Press Technique</u></p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image006.jpg"><br>
    An at car thrust arm bushing press can be accomplished by utilizing a 3 arm jaw
    puller (gear puller), a heavy duty short pipe cap, and the BMW thrust arm
    bushing press sleeve (referenced above).</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image007.jpg"><br>
    The jaw puller jaw teeth grasp the back perimeter of the thrust arm bore, while
    the jaw puller bolt pushes on the pipe cap which sits on the bushing metal
    sleeve. Tightening the bolt causes the pipe cap to press the bushing through
    the thrust arm bore.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image008.jpg"><br>
    The BMW press sleeve is inserted between the pipe cap and bushing and is
    pressed through the thrust arm bore to drive out the end portion of the bushing
    remaining in the arm bore.<br>

  <p>There are several tool (puller &amp; pipe cap) parameters
    that need to be taken into consideration.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The puller needs to be strong enough to handle the press forces;
    have fine bolt threads to facilitate hand/wrench tightening; long enough to
    accommodate the longest apparatus, new bushing initial insertion; and the jaw
    teeth short enough to not protrude into the bore bushing path, although a
    longer tooth length can also be worked with.<br>
    A 5 1/2" (6") 5 ton 2/3 jaw puller (7mm jaw teeth) generally accommodates these
    specifications, although the length is at the limits of the longest 8-cyl
    apparatus.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The pipe cap needs to be wider than the bushing outer
    diameter to fully seat on the bushing sleeve; not wider than the arm bore outer
    diameter so as not to touch the puller jaws; deep enough to avoid the bushing
    shaft end stud; short enough to facilitate the longest apparatus; strong enough
    to handle the press forces.<br>
    A 1 1/2" forged steel socket weld pipe cap accommodates these specifications.
    The 3k psi version works well for the 6-cyl parameters, but a wider 6k psi
    version is needed to accommodate the 8-cyl larger diameter bushing.<br>

    Thoroughly clean bushing sleeve (brake cleaner / towel).<br>
    Locate arrow marking on bushing rubber end. Either end will do. Mark edge of

    Utilize grinder (drill &amp; grind drill bit) to remove any raised writing on
    pipe cap top center.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Utilize drill and drill bit (1/4") to create a ~4mm dimple
    in center of pipe cap(s). Indentation should be large enough to fully receive
    jaw puller bolt tip and allow for slight side to side movement. A little grease
    is recommended for this type of drilling.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Clean jaw puller bolt threads and apply graphite based
    grease, brushing into threads. Thread bolt through yoke to remove excess

  </p>
  <p>To tighten the thrust arm bushing bolt/nut at the end of the
    repair, BMW requires the car be in "normal position".<br>
    This method is utilized for most front end suspension repairs, and is necessary
    to assure the bushing center is locked with the frame (tightened) at a neutral /
    middle of range suspension position. As the suspension maneuvers (up/down), the
    bushing outer sleeve will rotate/torque, but the center shaft will be locked in
    with an independent frame. The middle rubber bushing will consequently be
    twisted/torqued. To attempt to minimize this stress, the bushing center is
    tightened down in a suspension neutral / middle of range position, "normal
    position".<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>"Normal position" requires the car to be resting on all four
    wheels (level ground), with tires properly inflated (info at driver door frame),
    a full gas tank, and the car weighed down with 500lb; specifically: 150lb in
    each front seat (seat in center position), 150lb in center of back seat, 50lb
    in center of trunk. Note: The car needs to be moved some after weighing down to
    allow the suspension to settle into the intended position.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Tightening the thrust arm bolt/nut with the car on the
    ground is quite difficult. As an alternative, "normal position" can be emulated
    by jacking up the wheel carrier to the position achieved by the configuration.
    Of course to accomplish this, the position of the wheel carrier in that
    configuration, "normal position", would need to be known in advance.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image017.jpg"><br>
    Fill car gas tank. Inflate tires to proper pressures. Load car with 150lb in
    each front seat (seat in center position), 150lb in center of back seat, 50lb
    in center of trunk. Move car to settle suspension. Park car on level ground.
    Note: This is quite important to achieving a proper reading.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Remove front wheels center caps. Measure distance between
    wheel hub center cup bottom lip and fender rim directly above. Verify second
    front wheel has exact reading. If not, then car may not be on level ground.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>This measurement technique can be replicated when the wheel
    is off the car, which is the practical setup when performing the repair.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Note: On my car, 528i 2000 5sp standard suspension touring
    225/55 R16, the measurement decreased by 1/2" between the configuration without
    the weights (17 1/2") and then with the weights (17").<br>

    Counter hold thrust arm nut and unscrew bolt (18mm combo wrench, 18mm socket 1/2"
    / 1/2" ratchet) (8-cyl 21mm). Remove bolt by adjusting thrust arm (forward) to
    allow bolt to slip out. Allow thrust arm to drop and wrest on tie rod (arm).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>8-cyl: After nut is removed, move steering back near to the
    center.&nbsp;Bolt will scarcely clear center link at tie rod ball joint.&nbsp;A
    center link bend at that location provides the needed clearance. The steering
    will need to be moved slightly while bolt is being removed. Steering is moved
    from under car by pushing on steering system.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>This is a good opportunity to check the thrust arm ball
    joint. Rotate the arm (socket) on the bolt (ball). Movement should be stiff.
    Push arm (socket) in/out of bolt (ball). There should be no play (space). Check
    rubber boot for tears and grease leakage.<br>
    Any ball joint play or torn boot and the thrust arm needs to be replaced. Replace
    both thrust arm bushings.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image026.jpg"><br>
    Tightly strap thrust arm to tie rod to keep it from moving (cross tie with
    rope; tie to arm, then utilize 2 half-hitch knots on each cross, strongly
    tightening each half-hitch).<br>
    Note: A very tight strapping is necessary to minimizes thrust arm movements during
    press process.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>8-cyl: Thrust arm ties on bottom side of tie rod.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Thoroughly clean bushing insertion side (car inboard side)
    metal sleeve and thrust arm bore exterior (brake cleaner / towel, sandpaper).<br>
    Note: Cleaning bore exterior will also facilitate detection of next bushing
    tear (spill mark).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Note: When utilizing brake cleaner at car, spray cleaner on
    towel and then clean with towel. This method safeguards from inadvertently
    spraying brake cleaner on car rubber parts which can detrimentally affect them.<br>
    <br>

  <p>Bring parts and tools needed for bushing extraction and
    insertion to working area underneath car (new bushing, puller, press cap, press
    sleeve, grease, metric ruler, 1/2" combo wrench, 1/2" socket 3/8", 5/8" socket 1/2",
    3/8" ratchet, 1/2" ratchet).</p>

    1<sup>st</sup> side: Loosen small nuts on puller links enough to allow for
    movement of jaws and yoke (1/2" combo wrench, 1/2" socket 3/8" / 3/8" ratchet).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Thread/unthread puller bolt to insert ~80mm into puller
    yoke. Orient puller so main body is on bore insertion side (car inboard side),
    and jaw teeth are on the bore extraction side (car outboard side). Straddle
    thrust arm bore with puller jaws/teeth. Insert puller bolt into bushing center
    shaft. Hold jaw arms around bore with one hand while tightening puller bolt
    with other. Bolt thread is wider than bushing shaft and will stop bolt, thus
    creating needed back pressure on yoke. Moderately tighten puller bolt so puller
    is fully suspended from thrust arm (5/8" socket 1/2" / 1/2" ratchet).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>8-cyl: If puller bolt thread width narrower than bushing
    shaft, insert press cap and center on bushing sleeve, as performed in next step.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>2<sup>nd</sup> side: Strongly tighten loosened link nut/bolt
    (1/2" box wrench, 1/2" socket 3/8" / 3/8" ratchet).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>1<sup>st</sup> side: Adjust jaws to be evenly distributed
    around bore. Adjust jaw teeth to be completely inserted and perpendicular to
    bore. Jar jaw ends to adjust teeth (ratchet handle butt).<br>
    Tighten puller links bolts/nuts (1/2" box wrench, 1/2" socket 3/8" / 3/8" ratchet).
    Adjust puller jaws and teeth as before, but with more precision. Strongly
    tighten puller bolt. Strongly tighten links bolts/nuts.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>8-cyl: Puller jaw teeth are deeper than arm bore perimeter
    width and thus will not insert fully.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image029.jpg"><br>
    Loosen puller bolt and unthread ~40mm from bushing. Puller jaws will loosen,
    but puller will continue to be suspended from thrust arm.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image007.jpg"><br>
    Place some grease on press cap center area. Insert press cap into puller bolt
    path. Push press cap against bolt, inserting puller bolt tip into press cap
    dimple. Tighten puller bolt until press cap mates with bushing sleeve. Center press
    cap on bushing sleeve. **Check and adjust puller jaw teeth.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image030.jpg"><br>
    While grasping puller with one hand for leverage and stability, tighten puller
    bolt (5/8" socket 1/2" / 1/2" ratchet). After a few turns, a "crack" might be
    heard, indicating breaking of bushing seize. Continue "press" until press cap
    reaches and mates with thrust arm (puller bolt will tighten).<br>
    Note: Lubricants and grease on bushing sleeve provide no benefit to press
    process.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image031.jpg"><br>
    Unscrew puller bolt ~40mm. Insert press sleeve between press cap and bushing.
    Push press sleeve against press cap, and press cap against puller bolt. Tighten
    puller bolt until press sleeve mates with bushing sleeve. Center press cap on
    press sleeve, and press sleeve on bushing sleeve. Tighten puller bolt (5/8"
    socket 1/2" / 1/2" ratchet). Finely adjust press sleeve by taping it (ratchet
    handle butt). Press sleeve will be precisely positioned when bushing sleeve can
    be seen from around whole outside perimeter of press sleeve. **This is
    essential, and will take some effort to achieve. **Check and adjust puller jaw
    teeth.<br>
    Note: Thrust arm bore is notched at rim to facilitate small deviation
    adjustments of press sleeve during initial insertion.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image032.jpg"><br>
    While grasping puller with one hand for leverage and stability, tighten puller bolt
    (5/8" socket 1/2" / 1/2" ratchet). A crack or two might be heard initially,
    indicating adjustment of press sleeve by bore rim notch. Continue tightening
    until bushing slips out of bore (will feel lessening of pressure).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>8-cyl: Do not press bushing completely out of arm bore.
    Press until ~10mm of press sleeve remains outside bore, allowing ~8mm of
    bushing to remain in arm bore. This facilitates remounting puller with new
    bushing while old bushing is present to keep puller jaw teeth from protruding
    into arm bore opening. </p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image033.jpg"><br>
    Loosen puller bolt and remove press cap. Remove puller by allowing yoke to drop
    down towards floor and then slipping out jaw teeth from bore. Take care not to
    alter jaw positions. Remove press sleeve from the bore.<br>
    Note: Picture shows press sleeve inside arm bore.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>8-cyl: Puller does not come off arm due to the remaining
    bushing. Loosen one jaw link bolt/nut at yoke (1/2" box wrench, 1/2" socket 3/8"
    / 3/8" ratchet). This allows jaw to expand out and puller to slip off bushing /
    thrust arm." Take care not to alter any other jaw positions.<br>
    <br>

  <p>Unwind puller bolt fully to allow room for new bushing and
    press cap. Place some grease on press cap center area. Place back puller in
    reverse of removal. Insert press cap into puller bolt path, and push against
    puller bolt. Orient bushing so bushing end with marks is at press cap and marks
    lines up with orientation ridge on thrust arm (bore rim at arm neck). Insert
    new bushing in puller bolt / press cap path, and push against press cap.
    Tighten puller bolt, allowing bushing to enter thrust arm bore. Again, orient
    bushing so marks on sleeve lines up with orientation ridge on thrust arm.
    Center press cap on bushing sleeve. Tighten puller bolt (5/8" socket 1/2" / 1/2"
    ratchet). **Check and adjust puller jaw teeth. It"s essential they don"t
    protrude into bore opening. <br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>8-cyl:<br>
    Utilize 2" (150 psi) pipe cap for initial insertion of bushing (~10mm), then
    loosen puller bolt and replace with 1 1/2" (6k psi) pipe cap.<br>
    Strongly tighten loosened link nut/bolt (1/2" box wrench, 1/2" socket 3/8" / 3/8"
    ratchet) after initial bushing, press cap, and puller setup.<br>
    Once initial alignment setup is complete, begin to slowly tighten puller bolt
    in 1/4 turn increments. Adjust any slight bushing tilt by tapping on bushing
    sleeve at press cap (ratchet handle butt). Utilize drawn circumference line as
    an alignment reference. Repeat incremental insertion and adjustment process
    until bushing is inserted sufficiently (~5mm) to assure insertion alignment.
    Loosen puller bolt and realign as needed.</p>

    While grasping puller with one hand for leverage and stability, tighten puller
    bolt (5/8" socket 1/2" / 1/2" ratchet). When sleeve balance mark approaches
    bore edge, start measuring both ends of bushing sleeve (metric ruler). Stop
    press when both bushing ends protrude 14.5mm (8-cyl 12.5mm) from bore (equally
    protrude).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>8-cyl: Old bushing will be pressed out by new bushing.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384

    Loosen puller bolt and remove press cap. Allow puller yoke to drop down towards
    floor. Loosen one jaw link bolt/nut at yoke (1/2" box wrench, 1/2" socket 3/8"
    / 3/8" ratchet). This allows jaw to expand out and puller to slip off bushing /
    thrust arm." Take care not to alter any other jaw positions (useful for the
    second side).</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="thrust_arm_bushings_procedure_files/image037.jpg"><br>
    Clean bushing bolt and washer, and car fame mounting perimeters (brake cleaner
    / towel). Untie rope holding thrust arm to tie rod. Bring thrust arm back up to
    frame mount position. Align bushing shaft with frame bolt holes by moving
    thrust arm up/down and forward/backward. Look through frame hole to check alignment.
    Note bolt washer alignment ridges mate with bolt head. Insert bolt into
    frame/bushing from brake air duct side (8-cyl car inboard side). Adjust bushing
    position as needed (forward) to allow bolt through. Thread new self-locking nut
    onto bolt. Counter hold nut and tighten bolt (18mm box wrench, 18mm socket 1/2"
    / 1/2" ratchet) (8-cyl 21mm). Tighten bolt until snug, then loosen 1/2 turn.
    Align bolt washer ridges to bolt head.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Repeat above procedure for second side. Clean and re-grease
    puller bolt. Puller should be reused with little adjustment to jaws. Bushing
    press flow goes from car inboard side to car outboard side. It"s the mirror
    image of the 1st side setup.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384

    Adjust car front lift height to be as low as safely possible (3 ton jack stands
    on lowest setting) (use appropriate procedure).<br>
    For each side: Utilize lift (jack) to raise front wheel carrier to its "normal
    position". Measure distance between wheel hub center cup bottom lip and fender
    rim directly above, as performed in initial height assessment. Align bolt
    washer ridges to bolt head. Fully tighten bushing bolt/nut to 110 Nm (81 ft-lb)
    (18mm box wrench, 18mm socket 1/2" / torque wrench) (8-cyl 21mm 127 NM (94
    ft-lb)).<br>
    Lower wheel carrier.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Note: Caution should be utilized during this step as the
    weight of the car is supported on the suspension.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Note: To achieve wheel carrier "normal position" height, car
    will likely lift from jack stand (picture). Draw outline of jack stand
    perimeter on floor before raising wheel carrier. This facilitates returning jack
    stand to its original position incase of movement. After raising wheel carrier,
    raise jack stand height to provide closer backup support. Return jack stand to
    original height before lowering wheel carrier. Minimizing car front height will
    reduce car lift from jack stand (3 ton jack stands on lowest setting).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Note: Point wheel direction strait forward. Lock steering
    wheel and remove keys from ignition. This locks wheel carrier directional
    movement. Apply lift (jack) to wheel carrier perpendicularly from car outside
    (picture). This minimizes potential hub rotation, or side loading and slippage.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Note: Optimal placement of lift at wheel carrier is unclear.
    Leverage at wheel hub (picture) could exert excessive force and damage wheel
    bearings. Wheel hub can also rotate. Leverage under wheel carrier shelf could
    exert excessive force and damage ball joint(s). Utilize wood block to facilitate
    access of lift to wheel carrier shelf.<br>
