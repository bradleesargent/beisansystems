  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Introduction</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>"Vanos" is BMW"s name for its variable valve timing units.
    Vanos units take on various shapes and design according to car year and model
    (engine model). The vanos discussed here is BMW part # 11-36-1-748-036 (M50TU, US
    S50) and 11-36-1-748-819 (M52, S52). It"s a single vanos, meaning only the intake
    valve timing is varied. This vanos unit is part of BMW 6-cylinder engines M50TU,
    M52, US S50, S52. These engines were incorporated into a wide range of car
    models during years 1993-1999. They are found in the 3-series E36 93-97, 5-series
    E34 93-95 / E39 96-98, 7-series E38 95-98, Z3 Roadster 2.8 E36 96-98, EU Z3
    Coupe 2.8 E36 96-98, US M3 E36 94-99, US Z3 M E36 98-99.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>This vanos has been experiencing a failure. It has been
    diagnosed that the failure is due to deterioration of the vanos piston seal
    O-ring. It has been determined that the O-ring is made from Buna (Buna-N, NBR,
    Nitrile). Buna is a very common O-ring material, but is limited in its temperature
    and chemical resistance characteristics. Unfortunately it is fairing quite
    badly in the vanos/engine environment. The O-ring has been found to harden,
    shrink, and have flat surfaces. This deterioration is causing the O-ring to lose
    its functional characteristics and thus cause the vanos to fail. BMW has been engaged
    regarding this matter, but has elected to not address the issue, "No further
    development will be done". New (rebuilt) vanos units are being sold with the same
    Buna O-ring. BMW does not provide the vanos piston seal/O-ring as a separate
    part.<br>
    Here is a link to the Roadfly BMW E39 forum where much of this information was
    first made public regarding the double vanos: <a
href="http://bimmer.roadfly.com/bmw/forums/e39/7494631-2.html">http://bimmer.roadfly.com/bmw/forums/e39/7494631-2.html</a>.<br>
    The double vanos shares the same seals design and O-ring failure as the single
    vanos.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The piston O-ring lies under and provides support to a piston
    Teflon seal ring. Replacing the O-ring requires removing the Teflon seal to
    access the O-ring. The Teflon seal can not be practically removed from the
    piston seal groove without damaging it. Thus replacing the O-ring necessarily
    requires replacing the Teflon seal.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The Buna O-ring can be replaced with an O-ring made from
    Viton. Viton (FKM, Fluorocarbon) has similar functional characteristics to
    Buna, but has much higher temperature and chemical resistance characteristics.
    It"s also recommended for the automobile engine environment. The vanos Teflon
    (PTFE filled) seal is not a standard part and needs to be semi-custom manufactured.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The single vanos has one piston with one seal/O-ring. <br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>A vanos seal/O-ring repair kit can be acquired through
    Beisan Systems (bee-saan), <a href="http://www.beisansystems.com/products">www.beisansystems.com/products</a>.
    It includes a vanos replacement OEM Teflon seal and enhanced (Viton) O-ring.<br>
    Here is a link to the Roadfly BMW E39 forum where the double vanos seals
    product was first introduced: <a
href="http://bimmer.roadfly.com/bmw/forums/e39/8705552-2.html">http://bimmer.roadfly.com/bmw/forums/e39/8705552-2.html</a>.
    The double vanos utilizes the same Teflon and O-ring material and design as the
    single vanos.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Symptoms</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Cars experience:<br>
    Overall loss of torque and power, particularly in the lower RPM range, &lt; 3k.
    Bogging then surging at 3k RPM. Uneven power distribution and RPM transition.
    Engine hesitations in the lower RPM range, &lt; 3k. Louder idle and
    intermittent idle RPM hiccups. Difficult takeoffs. Loss of power and bogging
    when AC on. Increased fuel consumption.<br>
    Repairing the vanos seals provides:<br>
    Overall increase in torque and power, particularly in the lower RPM range, &lt;
    3k. Resolution of bogging then surging at 3k RPM. Smooth even distribution of
    power and RPM transition. Resolution of engine hesitations in the lower RPM
    range, &lt; 3k. Quiet stable idle. Smooth easy takeoffs. Improved performance
    when AC on. Reduced fuel consumption, by ~10%.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>In some cases the engine computer will generate the
    following fault code:<br>
    P1519 (BMW 212, 0xD4): Vanos mechanically stuck (jamming).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Diagnosis</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>A vanos fault code, as described above, without previous
    tampering with the engine timing, is most likely a vanos seals failure
    indication.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Otherwise the vanos needs to be removed from the engine for
    inspection. Once the vanos cylinder cover is removed, an inspection of the
    piston seals fit in the cylinders will show a loose fit and thus a seals
    failure. Removal of the seals from the piston will show the inner O-ring has
    flat spots and a loss of elasticity.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>In general, a diagnosis is not necessary. The vanos Buna
    O-ring is deteriorating in 20k miles (32k kilometers). Thus essentially all the
    cars with this vanos have a deteriorated seal O-ring and a failing vanos.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Repair Procedure</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The following is an E36, E34 &amp; E39 single vanos piston
    seals R&amp;R (remove and replace) procedure.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>If the valve cover gaskets are over 40k miles (64k
    kilometers) old, then it"s prudent to replace them during this repair. If they
    are over 80k miles (128k kilometers) old, then it is a requirement to replace
    them during this repair, otherwise they might leak due to being dismounted and
    reused. These gaskets have an estimate lifespan of ~60k miles (96k kilometers)
    and replacing them during this repair requires no extra effort. The needed parts
    and replacement procedure are included as optional.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Repair time: 4 hours mechanic, 6+ hours DIY.<br>

  </p>
  <p>Allow RTV sealant to dry a minimum of one hour before
    driving car.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>On first engine start after repair engine will experience a
    couple engine hiccups at idle. This might be related to trapped air in the
    vanos.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Check and replenish engine oil.<br>
    Drive car, then park car and let engine oil settle.<br>
    Remove oil dipstick; wipe dipstick end; fully reinsert dipstick; remove
    dipstick again; read oil marking. If oil is low add needed (small) amount of
    new oil at oil fill cap at valve cover.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>E36 &amp; E39:<br>
    Check and replenish coolant fluid.<br>
    When car is fully cold (morning), inspect coolant level at side of expansion
    tank (reservoir). Coolant should be at mid level. Fill coolant as needed.<br>
    Drive car until warm. Slightly open bleed screw at expansion and allow air to
    escape (Philips). Close bleed screw when only fluid is escaping.<br>
    Repeat fill and bleed procedure as needed to achieve proper coolant level.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>~100 miles (160 kilometers) of city driving is needed to
    break-in new seals to achieve smoother RPM transition.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Please provide feedback on vanos forum after seals break-in
    period. <a href="http://www.beisansystems.com/forum.html">www.beisansystems.com/forum.html</a><br>
