    Belt static friction method:<br>
    Remove fan / fan clutch from water pump shaft.<br>
    Place open wrench on fan clutch nut (32mm combo wrench). <u>Place wrench
    forward on nut to avoid hitting vanos body and thermostat hose connector</u>.
    Strongly strike wrench side at top with heavy hammer to break nut seize (sledge
    hammer); <u>left hand thread</u>.<br>
    Note: Nut is <u>left hand thread</u>, thus unscrew by hitting wrench top from
    left to right (car front orientation). Serpentine belt static friction on water
    pump pulley facilitates large enough opposing force to break nut seize. It is
    important to use a heavy hammer to produce a high instantaneous jerk. Several
    attempts will be needed before nut seize breaks. Rotate open wrench to
    reposition for better access.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>If belt static friction method is not successful, attempt
    pulley holding tool method.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384

  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="e39_fan_procedure_files/image012.jpg"><br>
    Pulley holding tool method:<br>
    Remove fan / fan clutch from water pump shaft.<br>
    Position water pump pulley for holding tool access. Water pump pulley has 2
    (adjacent) pairs of mounting bolts. Position one of the bolt pairs with left
    bolt at just to right of top center (picture) (32mm combo wrench).<br>
    Install water pump pulley holding tool onto pulley bolts. Position holding tool
    at right, and place tool indent curve against fan clutch nut. Mount tool end
    hole onto pulley bottom left bolt, and tool second hole onto pulley right bolt.
    Reposition fan clutch nut for better holding tool access (picture).<br>
    Place open wrench on fan clutch nut (32mm combo wrench). Counter hold holding
    tool and break clutch nut seize (32mm combo wrench); <u>left hand thread</u>.<br>
    Note: Nut is <u>left hand thread</u>, thus unscrew by turning wrench from left
    to right (car front orientation).<br>
    <br>
    If fun clutch nut seize difficult to break, apply lubricant to nut/threads
    contact surfaces (spray lubricant).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Once nut seize is broken, remove tools and spin fan blades
    to unscrew nut; <u>left hand thread</u>.<br>
    When nut is close to shaft end, turn fan slowly while continuously holding fan
    blades. This will keep fan from falling and damaging radiator fins when fully
    disconnected.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="e39_fan_procedure_files/image013.jpg"><br>
    Lift fan shroud up while maneuvering fan / fan clutch out of fan shroud and
    engine bay.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="e39_fan_procedure_files/image014.jpg"><br>
    Remove fan shroud from engine bay.<br>
    Remove expansion tank bleed screw, dislodge expansion tank from fan shroud,
    then reinstall bleed screw (Philips).<br>
    Pull up on fan shroud while removing expansion tank and hoses from shroud. Tilt
    fan shroud right side up to help removal. Pull out overflow hose from shroud access
    slot. Remove shroud from engine bay. Place expansion tank at high location in
    engine bay. Place overflow hose high to keep coolant from draining out.<br>
    Note: Coolant will leak out from radiator overflow hose. Keep expansion tank
    height low to minimize leakage.<br>
    <br>

  <p><u>From top of car</u></p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="e39_fan_procedure_files/image015.jpg"><br>
    Install fan shroud.<br>
    Position expansion tank at engine bay left side to mate with fan shroud.<br>
    Tilt shroud right side up and slide shroud into position while attaching
    expansion tank to shroud.<br>
    Insert expansion tank overflow hose into shroud access slot and lay on top of
    radiator.<br>
    Remove expansion tank bleed screw (Philips), fully install expansion tank onto
    shroud, and reinstall bleed screw (Philips).<br>
    Align shroud by pulling up, forward, and dropping into position.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="e39_fan_procedure_files/image016.jpg"><br>
    Insert fan/clutch in fan shroud. Lift fan shroud up and forward while
    maneuvering fan/clutch into fan shroud.<br>
    Note: Fan is oriented with clutch nut to car rear.<br>
    Align shroud by pulling up, forward, and dropping down into lower frame slots.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=383
src="e39_fan_procedure_files/image017.jpg"><br>
    Mount fan/clutch onto water pump shaft.<br>
    Lift fan and mate (hang) fan clutch nut onto water pump shaft. Rotate fan to
    find best nut thread to shaft thread mate. At optimal fit, fan will hang on
    shaft without threading (picture).<br>
    With fan hanging independently on shaft, slowly turn fan blades to thread nut
    onto shaft; <u>left hand thread</u>. Fully thread nut onto shaft.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="e39_fan_procedure_files/image018.jpg"><br>
    Place open wrench on fan clutch nut (32mm combo wrench) and lightly hit wrench
    top with heavy hammer, one time; <u>left hand thread</u> (sledge hammer).<br>
    Note: Serpentine belt static friction on water pump pulley facilitates large
    enough opposing force to tighten clutch nut. Fan opposing spin also tightens
    fan clutch nut.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="e39_fan_procedure_files/image019.jpg"><br>
    Lift fan shroud up and to rear. Insert overflow hose clamp onto overflow hose with
    clamp bolt head at bottom and facing forward (picture). Mount overflow hose
    onto radiator overflow neck. Position hose clamp onto radiator overflow neck
    and tighten clamp (Philips). Note: Position clamp bolt at bottom of radiator
    neck to allow for proper fan shroud fitment.</p>
