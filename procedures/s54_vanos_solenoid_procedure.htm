  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Introduction</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>�Vanos� is BMW�s name for its variable valve timing units.
    Vanos units take on various shapes and design according to car year and model
    (engine model). The vanos discussed here is BMW part # 11-36-7-838-161. It�s a
    double vanos, meaning both the intake and exhaust valve timing is varied. This
    vanos unit is part of BMW 6-cylinder engine S54. This engine is incorporated
    into the M3 E46 00-06, Z3 E36 M Roadster &amp; M Coup 00-02, Z4 E85 M3.2
    Roadster 05-08, Z4 E86 M3.2 Coup 06-08.<br>
    <br>
    This vanos experiences three unit failures and two related failures. The primary
    vanos failure is a vanos solenoid coil pack malfunction. The second, and less
    common, vanos failure is sticking solenoid valves. The third vanos failure is deteriorating
    vanos solenoid sealing plate rubber rings. These failures are the focus of this
    procedure.<br>
    The other two vanos related failures are, a rattle caused by loose intake
    sprocket mounting bolts, and vanos malfunction caused by broken vanos oil pump exhaust
    sprocket hub driver tab(s).</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="s54_vanos_solenoid_procedure_files/image001.jpg"><br>
    The vanos solenoid coil pack (black plastic housing) failure is due to cracked
    solder joints. The damaged solder joints are of the connector pins at the PCB
    (printed circuit board).<br>
    <br>
    There are three main causes of damaged solder joints: cold solder joint, heat
    cycling, and mechanical movement. Although all the connector pin solder joints
    are experiencing structural damage, the inner row of pins (intake side) almost
    always experience significant damage and failure while the outer row of pins
    (exhaust side) usually maintain the solder connection and don�t experience
    functional failure. This position specific nature of the failure indicates the
    cause of the failure is likely vibration. Cold solder joint might also be involved
    causing weak solder structure.<br>
    <br>
    The solder damage could be caused by external electrical cable/connector
    movement. But the connector has a silicon gasket that maintains good condition
    and firmly mounts the cable connector to the coil pack connector. There is also
    a cable tie which straps the electrical cable just past the connector to the
    coil pack. Thus cable and cable connector movement is not likely the cause of
    the solder joint damage.<br>
    <br>
    There is a cavity in the coil pack housing where the connector pins enter the
    housing (below picture). This leaves a long section of the pins not secured
    (potted). Also the PCB is last mounted from top onto the housing a relatively
    long distance from the connector pin solder joints (below picture). Both these design
    aspects are potential contributors to the likely vibration that damages the
    connector pins solder joints.<br>
    <br>
    The Beisan solution involves repairing the connector pin solder joints and incorporating
    design changes to address the problems that likely facilitate the failure.<br>
    The coil pack cover is cut off to open the unit and facilitate the repair. The
    cover is remounted with sealing adhesive.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="s54_vanos_solenoid_procedure_files/image002.jpg"><br>
    Epoxy is inserted in the connector pins cavity to better secure the pins.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="s54_vanos_solenoid_procedure_files/image003.jpg"><br>
    A new bolt is introduced to mount the PCB from top closer to the connector
    pins. A board alignment stud is removed and the bolt is mounted in its place.<br>
    <br>
    The pins solder joints are removed and the joints are newly soldered.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The vanos solenoid valve sticking failure is due to sludge
    buildup in the valve piston cylinders. The solution is to clean the valve
    passages to remove the sludge.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="s54_vanos_solenoid_procedure_files/image004.jpg"><br>
    The vanos solenoid sealing plate rubber rings failure is due to the rubber material
    being Buna (NBR, Nitrile). Buna is limited to 100C (212F) and engine temperatures
    rise above this level. As a consequence the rubber rings are experiencing
    notable compression set (flattening) which is allowing oil seepage. Notable compression
    set is a direct outcome of temperature over exposure.<br>
    <br>
    The Beisan solution to the sealing plate is to cut out the failed rubber rings
    and install Viton material O-rings of the same thickness as new sealing plate
    rubber rings. Viton is rated to 204C (400F) and is appropriate for the sealing
    plate application.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Symptoms</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Fault codes:<br>
    <br>
    P0010 (BMW xx, 0xxx): Vanos intake solenoid circuit<br>
    P0011 (BMW 67, 0x43): Vanos intake timing over advanced<br>
    P0012 (BMW 72, 0x48): Vanos intake timing over retarded<br>
    Pxxxx (BMW 184, 0xB8): Vanos intake position control<br>
    P1525 (BMW xx, 0xxx): Vanos intake solenoid open circuit<br>
    <br>
    P0013 (BMW xx, 0xxx): Vanos exhaust solenoid circuit<br>
    P0014 (BMW 22, 0x16): Vanos exhaust timing over advanced<br>
    P0015 (BMW 21, 015): Vanos exhaust timing over retarded<br>
    Pxxxx (BMW 185, 0xB9): Vanos exhaust position control<br>
    P1531 (BMW xx, 0xxx): Vanos exhaust solenoid open circuit<br>
    <br>
    The failure of the vanos solenoid will cause the DME to not utilize the vanos.
    Unfortunately the engine timing is left in the same position as when the
    failure occurred. Thus the engine will likely behave better at low RPM and
    worse at high RPM, or worse at low RPM and better at high RPM. Engine misfire with
    fault codes can also occur.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Diagnosis</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>If a circuit code is present, disconnect the vanos solenoid
    electrical connector and spray clean both connectors with electronic contact
    cleaner. If this doesn�t resolve the code then the solenoid coil pack is likely
    failed.<br>
    <br>
    A relatively less common failure that causes the above codes, less the
    electrical codes, is sticking solenoid valves. The solenoid valves can be
    cleaned as outlined in the procedure to address this possibility.<br>
    <br>
    The above codes, less the electrical codes, can also occur when the vanos oil
    pump driver tabs break. Thus an effort must be taken to distinguish between the
    vanos solenoid coil pack failure and the oil pump driver tab(s) breakage.<br>
    <br>
    A simple, but not conclusive, method of differentiating between the two
    failures is to reset the fault codes and start the engine and allow it to idle.
    If the oil pump driver tabs are broken the fault codes and check engine light
    will be generated in a few minutes. The solenoid coil pack failure is often
    intermittent and will take some driving before the fault codes and check engine
    light appear.<br>
    Unfortunately, there are cases where the solenoid coil pack can be
    significantly failed and the fault codes and check engine light appear at idle
    after reset. Further in some cases only one of the oil pump driver tabs will
    break. In such a case the fault codes and check engine light will not appear at
    idle and some driving will be necessary for them to appear.<br>
    <br>
    A definitive method of assessing which of the two failures exists is to remove
    the valve cover and inspect the oil pump driver tabs. If one or both are broken
    then that is the source of the problem. If they are present then the problem is
    most likely the solenoid coil pack.<br>
    <br>

  <p>The following is an E46 M3 vanos solenoid coil pack R&amp;R
    (remove and replace) procedure.<br>

    The engine fault codes will need to be reset at the end of the repair to allow
    the DME (engine computer) to utilize the vanos.<br>
