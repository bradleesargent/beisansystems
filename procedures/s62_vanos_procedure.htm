  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Introduction</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>“Vanos” is BMW’s name for its variable valve timing units.
    Vanos units take on various shapes and design according to car year and model
    (engine model). The vanos units discussed here are BMW part # 11-36-7-831-486 and
    11-36-7-831-487. They are a double vanos, meaning both the intake and exhaust
    valve timing is varied. These vanos units are identical with only the solenoid
    pack and solenoid cover installed upside-down. They are part of BMW 8-cylinder
    engine S62. This engine is incorporated into the E39 M5 98-03, E52 Z8 Roadster 99-03.<br>
    <br>
    This vanos piston seals and static seal O-rings are made of the correct
    materials and don’t experience premature failure. However over time and use the
    piston seal O-rings will experience notable compression set (flattening) and
    the Teflon rings will experience wear (loss of material). This can lead to
    degradation in performance. The static seal O-rings will also experience
    notable compression set and could eventually leak. Thus there is a need for a replacement
    seals solution for this vanos.<br>
    <br>
    A vanos seals/O-rings repair kit can be acquired through Beisan Systems
    (bee-saan), <a href="http://www.beisansystems.com/products">www.beisansystems.com/products</a>.
    It includes a vanos replacement set of OEM equivalent material Teflon rings and
    Viton O-rings.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Symptoms</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Loss of low end torque, uneven power delivery, and overall
    loss of power.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Diagnosis</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The BMW DIS vanos diagnostic test can be run to assess speed
    and preciseness of adjustment.<br>

  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Repair Procedure</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The following is an E39 M5 vanos seals R&amp;R (remove and
    replace) procedure.<br>
    <br>
    Repair time: 12 hours mechanic, 12+ hours DIY.<br>

  <p><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Parts, Tools, and Shop
    Supplies</span></u><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Parts with part number pattern xx-xx-x-xxx-xxx are BMW parts
    and can be acquired from a BMW dealership.<br>
    Beisan Systems only provides the seals repair kit.</p>

    S62 vanos seals repair kit, MY 98 (BS061.1), MY 99+ (BS061.2) $120/each. Picture
    is BS061.2.<br>
    Note: Car model year 98 utilizes part BS061.1. Subsequent car model years 99+
    utilize part BS061.2. The difference between the two products is the piston
    small seal size.<br>
    Note: Seals repair kit covers both vanos units and thus only one seals kit is
    necessary.<br>
    Note: Seals kit incorporates 2 vanos oil pressure restrictor O-rings and 2
    secondary air pipe end O-rings</p>
