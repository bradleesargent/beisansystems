    </b><br>
    "Vanos" is BMW"s name for its variable valve timing units. Vanos units take on
    various shapes and design according to car year and model (engine model). The
    vanos units discussed here are BMW part # 11-36-7-831-486 and 11-36-7-831-487. They
    are a double vanos, meaning both the intake and exhaust valve timing is varied.
    These vanos units are identical with only the solenoid pack and solenoid cover
    installed in reverse. They are part of BMW 8-cylinder engine S62. This engine
    is incorporated into the E39 M5 98-03, E52 Z8 Roadster 99-03.<br>
    <br>
    This vanos, like most vanos designs, can develop a rattle. The vanos rattle is
    caused by wear in the variable valve timing helical (slanted) gears. These
    gears are found on the camshaft sprocket and splined shaft, which attaches to
    the vanos. The helical gear wear allows the camshaft to have lash movements
    that engage the splined shaft axially. At certain RPMs these movements resonate
    and engage axial play (free space) and cause associate components to hit and
    rattle. The axial play that facilitates the rattle is found on the helical
    gears and the splined shaft bearing. Replacing the helical gear components is
    expensive and the gears will wear again and the rattle will return. Removing
    the splined shaft bearing axial play significantly reduces the rattle to the
    point where it"s barely heard or not heard at all in the passenger compartment.
    Performance cams like the ones on this engine create stronger camshaft lash
    forces and thus are more susceptible to causing a rattle.<br>
    <br>
    Another component that addresses the rattle is the diaphragm spring that"s
    incorporated in the intake and exhaust sprockets. This spring loads the
    sprocket rotational movement to dampen the rattle quick movements.<br>
    Over time the diaphragm spring weakens and degrades in function. Replacing the
    diaphragm spring with a new one is often needed to fully resolve the rattle.<br>
    The S62 diaphragm spring was redesigned by BMW and is now thicker. This new part
    is more effective and lasts longer. It was incorporated into the S62 engine
    starting model year 02 cars.<br>
    <br>
    For an in depth discussion of the rattle cause and solution reference the
    Beisan single and double rattle procedure and single diaphragm spring procedure
    introductions.<br>
    <br>
    The splined shaft bearing is made of a thick washer and two thrust (roller)
    bearings. The washer incorporates a stud that"s mounted to the vanos piston.
    The two thrust bearings sandwich the washer facilitating the splined shaft to
    rotate at camshaft speed without rotating the vanos piston. The washer and two
    thrust bearings are incased in a ring and two outer flat washers. The complete
    bearing is housed inside a splined shaft cavity and is closed off with a
    threaded cover.<br>
    <br>
    Removing the splined shaft bearing axial play requires modifying or replacing one
    or more bearing components. The thrust bearings are a standard part and are
    manufactured to tight tolerances. It"s not feasible to modify or replace them. The
    center washer is also manufactured to a tight tolerance. The ring is a
    non-standard part and is manufactured to loose tolerance. It"s also made of
    standard steel that is annealed (soft). This is causing it to be scored by the
    center washer and thrust bearing. The outer flat washers reside inside the ring
    and thus influence the bearing axial fit. The washers are a standard bearing
    part, but due to their stamped manufacturing have a notable tolerance range
    which can significantly affect the bearing axial fit.<br>
    The ring can be replaced with a ring made of bearing steel that"s hardened and
    ground to bearing standards. Its height can be tightly controlled to provide a
    tight bearing axial fit. Standard bearing washers that have been measured and
    sorted can be combined to provide the needed height to provide a tight bearing
    axial fit. A bearing adjustment can be made at installation to address any
    minor axial fit variation.<br>
    <br>
    The vanos rattle repair kit includes four sets of replacement bearing ring and
    two outer washers.<br>
    <br>
    Opening the splined shaft to modify the bearing requires counter holding the
    splined shaft and unscrewing the cover. The splined shaft doesn"t have a built
    in area for tool holding, and the cover only has two holes in it for manipulation.
    The cover threads also have high strength thread locker which makes cover removal
    difficult.<br>
    A splined shaft holder tool is needed to receive and hold the splined shaft,
    and a socket tool with dowels is needed to insert into the holes in the splined
    shaft cover and open and close it.<br>
    <br>
    The vanos rattle tools includes a splined shaft holder and splined shaft
    socket. The holder is square and mounts in a vise and receives and counter
    holds the splined shaft. The socket is a standard 1/2" drive size and has dowels
    that mount into the splined shaft cover holes to open and close the cover. The
    socket is designed to be used with an impact wrench to overcome the cover
    thread locker. The socket is also used with a torque wrench for final
    tightening.<br>

  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Symptoms</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Vanos rattle at a certain RPM range, often 1800-2200 RPM.
    Rattle can also occur at idle.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Repair Procedure</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The following is an S62 vanos splined shaft bearing rattle
    repair procedure. As part of the repair the sprocket hub diaphragm springs and associate
    pressure plates are replaced with S62 parts. The S62 parts have been redesigned
    and have a thicker/stronger diaphragm spring to better control the rattle.<br>
    <br>
    This repair is performed in conjunction with the S62 vanos seals repair.<br>

    Install vanos remaining 7 mounting bolts (5mm hex bit socket 3/8" / 3/8"
    ratchet &amp; extension).<br>
    Tighten all bolts evenly in multiple passes to draw vanos to engine head
    evenly.<br>
    Note: If bolts difficult to tighten then hub top bolts are not loosened
    sufficiently.<br>
    Fully tighten, 10 Nm (7 ft-lb) (5mm hex bit socket 3/8" / 3/8" torque wrench
    &amp; extension).<br>
    Tighten bolts evenly in multiple passes. Verify one pass with all bolts fully
    tightened.<br>

    Fully tighten bank 1 &amp; 2 intake and exhaust hub top 3 mounting bolts. For
    each bank perform following.<br>
    Tighten intake and exhaust hubs top 3 mounting bolts (10mm open wrench).<br>
    Tighten bolts evenly in multiple passes. Verify one pass with all bolts tight.<br>
    Note: Bolts will be mostly tightened since they were tightened in previous
    step.<br>
    Note: Bolts will be tightened again in below step, thus do not overly tighten
    at this time.</p>

    Unlock banks 1 &amp; 2 intake and exhaust camshafts. For each bank perform
    following.<br>
    For intake and exhaust camshafts perform following.<br>
    Remove locking pin in camshaft first bearing hole. Rock camshaft back and forth
    (27mm open wrench) while pulling up and removing locking pin.<br>
    Note: Exhaust camshaft access is limited for standard 27mm open wrench. Use
    short handle adjustable wrench as needed.</p>

    Turn crankshaft pulley clockwise one full rotation until timing marks match
    again (32mm socket 1/2" / 1/2" long-arm ratchet &amp; extension).<br>
    When 3/4 through turn start inspecting TDC (top dead center) timing marks on
    engine timing cover and crankshaft harmonic balancer at ~11 o"clock position
    (mirror).<br>
    Adjust crankshaft pulley to align TDC timing marks (32mm socket 1/2" / 1/2" long-arm
    ratchet &amp; extension).<br>
    Note: Timing marks are far from each other and thus difficult to align. It is
    easier to align locking pin holes in harmonic balancer and locking bracket
    (picture).<br>
    Note: Turning crankshaft counter clockwise is acceptable.<br>
    Note: Precise alignment is not necessary.</p>
