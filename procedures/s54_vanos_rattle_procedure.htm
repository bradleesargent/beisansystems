  <p>“Vanos” is BMW’s name for its variable valve timing units.
    Vanos units take on various shapes and design according to car year and model
    (engine model). The vanos discussed here is BMW part # 11-36-7-838-161. It’s a
    double vanos, meaning both the intake and exhaust valve timing is varied. This
    vanos unit is part of BMW 6-cylinder engine S54. This engine is incorporated
    into the M3 E46 00-06, Z3 E36 M Roadster &amp; M Coup 00-02, Z4 E85 M3.2
    Roadster 05-08, Z4 E86 M3.2 Coup 06-08.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>This vanos, like most vanos designs, can develop a rattle.
    The vanos rattle is caused by wear in the variable valve timing helical
    (slanted) gears. These gears are found on the camshaft sprocket and splined
    shaft, which attaches to the vanos. The helical gear wear allows the camshaft
    to have lash movements that engage the splined shaft axially. At certain RPMs
    these movements resonate and engage axial play (free space) and cause associate
    components to hit and rattle. The axial play that facilitates the rattle is
    found on the helical gears and the splined shaft bearing. Replacing the helical
    gear components is expensive and the gears will wear again and the rattle will
    return. Removing the splined shaft bearing axial play significantly reduces the
    rattle to the point where it’s barely heard or not heard at all in the
    passenger compartment. Performance cams like the ones on this engine create
    stronger camshaft lash forces and thus are more susceptible to causing a
    rattle.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Another component that addresses the rattle is the diaphragm
    spring that’s incorporated in the intake and exhaust sprockets. This spring
    loads the sprocket rotational movement to dampen the rattle quick movements.<br>
    Over time the diaphragm spring weakens and degrades in function. Replacing the
    diaphragm spring with a new one is often needed to fully resolve the rattle.<br>
    This diaphragm spring design is used on the S54 and S62 engines. On the S54 engine
    the part number is 11-36-7-830-684. On the S62 engine the part number is 11-36-7-833-218.
    But with the S62 engine BMW redesigned the diaphragm spring to thicken it. This
    part is more effective and lasts longer.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>For an in depth discussion of the rattle cause and solution reference
    the Beisan single and double rattle procedure and single diaphragm spring
    procedure introductions.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The splined shaft bearing is made of a thick washer and two
    thrust (roller) bearings. The washer incorporates a stud that’s mounted to the
    vanos piston. The two thrust bearings sandwich the washer facilitating the splined
    shaft to rotate at camshaft speed without rotating the vanos piston. The washer
    and two thrust bearings are incased in a ring and two outer flat washers. The
    complete bearing is housed inside a splined shaft cavity and is closed off with
    a threaded cover.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Removing the splined shaft bearing axial play requires
    modifying or replacing one or more bearing components. The thrust bearings are
    a standard part and are manufactured to tight tolerances. It’s not feasible to
    modify or replace them. The center washer is also manufactured to a tight
    tolerance. The ring is a non-standard part and is manufactured to loose
    tolerance. It’s also made of standard steel that is annealed (soft). This is
    causing it to be scored by the center washer and thrust bearing. The outer flat
    washers reside inside the ring and thus influence the bearing axial fit. The
    washers are a standard bearing part, but due to their stamped manufacturing
    have a notable tolerance range which can significantly affect the bearing axial
    fit.<br>
    The ring can be replaced with a ring made of bearing steel that’s hardened and
    ground to bearing standards. Its height can be tightly controlled to provide a
    tight bearing axial fit. Standard bearing washers that have been measured and
    sorted can be combined to provide the needed height to provide a tight bearing
    axial fit. A bearing adjustment can be made at installation to address any
    minor axial fit variation.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The vanos rattle repair kit includes two sets of replacement
    bearing ring and two outer washers.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Opening the splined shaft to modify the bearing requires
    counter holding the splined shaft and unscrewing the cover. The splined shaft
    doesn’t have a built in area for tool holding, and the cover only has two holes
    in it for manipulation. The cover threads also have high strength thread locker
    which makes cover removal difficult.<br>
    A splined shaft holder tool is needed to receive and hold the splined shaft,
    and a socket tool with dowels is needed to insert into the holes in the splined
    shaft cover and open and close it.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The vanos rattle tools includes a splined shaft holder and
    splined shaft socket. The holder is square and mounts in a vise and receives
    and counter holds the splined shaft. The socket is a standard 1/2” drive size
    and has dowels that mount into the splined shaft cover holes to open and close
    the cover. The socket is designed to be used with an impact wrench to overcome
    the cover thread locker. The socket is also used with a torque wrench for final
    tightening.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The exhaust upper chain guide mating section with the
    exhaust lower chain guide wears and breaks by ~80k miles. It also causes uneven
    wear and damage to the exhaust lower chain guide mating surface. The exhaust
    upper chain guide, which is made from virgin Nylon and has a webbed center
    body, can be replaced with a chain guide that is made from a superior Nylon and
    has a solid body that will allow the chain guide to last 250+k miles. It will
    also enact even wear and less wear on the lower chain guide allowing it to have
    a longer functional lifespan.<br>

  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Symptoms</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Vanos rattle at a certain RPM range, often 1800-2200 RPM.
    Rattle can also occur at idle.<br>
    <br>

  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Repair Procedure</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The following is an S54 vanos splined shaft bearing rattle
    repair procedure. As part of the repair the sprocket hub diaphragm springs and associate
    pressure plates are replaced with S62 parts. The S62 parts have been redesigned
    and have a thicker/stronger diaphragm spring to better control the rattle.</p>
  <p>The procedure also addresses replacing the sprocket sleeve
    bolts that come loose on the intake side, and implicitly covers replacing the
    exhaust sprocket hub that can experience broken driver tabs.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>This repair is performed in conjunction with the S54 vanos
    seals and oil pump disk repair.<br>

    <br>
  </p>
  <p>If timing alignment is found to be incorrect, perform
    following procedure to adjust timing.<br>
    Timing adjustment procedure presumes engine position at end of timing checking;
    crankshaft at TDC with lock pin removed, intake and exhaust camshaft cylinder 1
    cams pointing in to each other at ~45 degree angle.<br>
    <br>
    Perform timing adjustment for camshaft(s) with incorrect timing alignment.<br>
    <br>
    Turn crankshaft pulley clockwise one full rotation until timing marks match
    again (crankshaft turning socket 1/2&quot; / 1/2” long-arm ratchet &amp; short
    extension).<br>
    <br>
    Loosen sprocket hub 3 top mounting bolts (10mm ratcheting wrench). Note: Bolts
    need to be notably loose so once opposite side 3 bolts are loosened hub will be
    free.<br>
    <br>
    Turn crankshaft pulley clockwise one full rotation until timing marks match
    again (crankshaft turning socket 1/2&quot; / 1/2” long-arm ratchet &amp; short
    extension).<br>
    Adjust crankshaft pulley to precisely align TDC timing marks (crankshaft
    turning socket 1/2&quot; / 1/2” long-arm ratchet &amp; short extension).<br>
    Install crankshaft locking pin in timing cover bracket hole.<br>
    <br>
    Fully retard camshaft timing.<br>
    Place open wrench (24mm combo wrench) on camshaft hex at front of camshaft.<br>
    Rotate camshaft counter clockwise to adjustment end position. If camshaft
    resistant to rotation rock camshaft back and forth to release seize.<br>
    Note: Camshaft rotation is most effective when standing at exhaust side of car.<br>
    Note: Splined shaft can be seen protruding from sprocket hub front when
    camshaft is at adjustment end position.<br>
    <br>
    Loosen sprocket hub 3 top mounting bolts (10mm ratcheting wrench).<br>
    Note: All sprocket hub bolts are now loose.<br>
    <br>
    Install vanos alignment bridge without alignment dowel on engine head between
    cylinders 2 &amp; 3.<br>
    Note: Bridge has intake and exhaust orientation. Note: E is intake and A is
    exhaust in German.<br>
    Insert bridge alignment dowel through bridge hole and insert dowel into
    camshaft alignment hole.<br>
    Note: Lift up bridge intake or exhaust end as necessary to align and insert
    dowel into camshaft hole.<br>
    Rotate camshaft at hex between cylinder 1 &amp; 2 to align camshaft alignment
    hole perpendicular to engine head and allow bridge ends to sit on engine head
    (24mm open wrench).<br>
    Fully insert bridge dowel into camshaft and onto bridge. Turn and press down
    dowel as needed to fully insert.<br>
    Place hand on middle of bridge and rock camshaft back and forth to identify and
    set camshaft in position where bridge intake and exhaust ends are sitting flat
    on engine head.<br>
    Remove alignment dowel and bridge.<br>
    <br>
    Follow above procedure starting at step just after mounting and tightening all
    vanos mounting bolts.<br>
    Perform sprocket hub bolt tightening only for adjusted camshaft(s).<br>
