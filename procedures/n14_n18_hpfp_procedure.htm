    <br>
  </p>
  <p>An automotive high pressure fuel pump is a device that
    generates very high fuel pressure for the engine. The fuel tank electric fuel
    pump pressurizes fuel to ~4 bar (~60 psi). A high pressure fuel pump further
    pressurizes this fuel to ~200 bar (~3k psi). This high pressure fuel is used
    for engine direct fuel injection (inside cylinder fuel injection), and
    facilitates high precision fuel control for optimal engine function and
    efficient fuel consumption. A high pressure fuel pump is a mechanical device,
    as high mechanical forces are needed to produce such high fuel pressures. It is
    normally connected to and driven by the engine.<br>
    <br>
    The N14/N18 high pressure fuel pump is a rotary type pump that utilizes
    hydraulic fluid (oil) for the pumping action. The rotor on the pump, which is
    driven by the engine, is connected to and turns a swash plate (slanted disk).
    As the swash plate rotates it causes the reciprocation of hollow spring loaded
    pistons in/out of cylinders. The hydraulic fluid filled pistons expand and
    deflate bellows (balloons) as they pump and then release hydraulic fluid in/out
    of the bellows. The bellows expansion presses on fuel, in a fuel chamber,
    causing a check valve to open and accept the pressurized fuel into the high
    pressure fuel rail. The bellows deflation draws fuel, in the same fuel chamber,
    causing a second check valve to open and allow in new unpressurized fuel from
    the low pressure fuel supply. There are 3 sets of pumping piston, spring,
    cylinder, bellow, fuel chamber, in/out check valves. An electronic solenoid,
    driven by a PWM (pulse width modulation) signal, controls the fuel flow into
    the pump and thus in turn the high pressure fuel output of the pump into the
    high pressure fuel rail.<br>
    <br>
    The N14/N18 HPFP (high pressure fuel pump) experiences one primary failure. The
    bellows’ upper collar incorporates a small O-ring which separates the fuel
    chamber from the pump hydraulic fluid chamber. This O-ring fails and allows
    fuel to seep into the hydraulic fluid chamber. The hydraulic fluid then becomes
    contaminated and this changes its functional characteristics which causes the
    HPFP to malfunction. The contaminated hydraulic fluid becomes excessively thin
    and this allows it to leak past the pistons when the pistons are pumped to fill
    and expand the bellows to pressurize the fuel. As the hydraulic fluid becomes
    more and more degraded, the pump fuel pressure further and further reduces,
    eventually causing notable engine performance symptoms.<br>
    <br>
    The bellow O-ring failure is due to degradation from high pressure fuel.
    Although the HPFP housing is designed to expose the bellow O-ring to minimal
    fuel pressure, in application the O-ring is still exposed to levels of fuel
    pressure it cannot endure. The O-ring experiences two degradations. Primarily,
    it experiences significant compression set (permanent flattening). This reduces
    the O-ring sealing force and allows leakage. Secondarily, the O-ring loses
    material, either from shredding or from abrasion, depending on the O-ring
    material, and this further allows leakage. It is also likely the O-ring low
    temperature operation limit is also a failure point. At temperatures below
    operating temperature limit an O-ring rubber will not seal well and will allow
    leakage.<br>
    <br>
    The bellow O-ring has been redesigned multiple times by BMW (ContiTech). Beisan
    has found 4 O-ring designs from inspecting used failed HPFPs.<br>
    The following is a list of the O-rings, 1-4, oldest to newest design, with a
    description of the O-ring and its seeming failure mode.<br>
    <br>
    O-ring 1 is a standard O-ring design and is likely made from Viton 75 durometer
    (hardness). It is relatively thin and thus will easily leak from moderate
    compression set created from the fuel high pressure.<br>
    O-ring 2 is a custom design O-ring and is likely made from Viton 70 durometer.
    Although the design is seemingly quite good, the low durometer makes is
    susceptible to compression set and shredding form the fuel high pressure.<br>
    O-ring 3 is a standard design O-ring and is likely made from Viton 75
    durometer. It is relatively thick and is cut when installed. It has the benefit
    of better filling the bellow O-ring cavity. But it also experiences compression
    set and shredding.<br>
    O-ring 4 is a standard design O-ring and is likely made from Fluorosilicone 75
    durometer. It is relatively thin and experiences significant compression set
    and material loss from abrasion. The change in material from Viton to Fluorosilicone,
    which is a combination of Viton and Silicon, is an indication the design change
    was made to address low temperature operation, as Viton operates down to -15F
    (-26C) and Fluorosilicone operates down to -70F (-56C).<br>
    <br>
    The following is a discussion of the bellow O-ring needed features and the BMW
    O-rings design failures.<br>
    <br>
    Viton (fluorocarbon, FKM) is an almost optimal O-ring material. It is resistant
    to most chemicals and has an upper operating temperature of 400F (200C). It has
    the best compression set resistance of all the O-ring rubber materials. It is
    not susceptible to tearing or abrasion. Its only weak point is a lower
    operating temperature of -15F (-26C). But of recent times, rubber manufacturers
    are offering Viton versions that operate down to -24F (-31C) and -40F (-40C),
    reducing the fluorine content from 69% to 67%. BMW used Fluorosilicone rubber
    instead of low temperature Viton to address cold region requirements. But Fluorosilicone
    is significantly more susceptible to compression set (flattening) and abrasion
    than Viton. A better choice of material would have been low temperature Viton.<br>
    <br>
    Standard rubber durometer (hardness) is 75 Shore A scale. High pressure
    applications are known to cause O-ring leakage, compression set, and rubber
    shredding/abrasion. The solution is the use of high durometer rubber. A high
    durometer rubber provides higher compression forces to prevent leakage,
    significantly lower compression set (flattening), and higher resistance to
    shredding/abrasion. Viton is available in a high hardness 90 durometer. BMW did
    not use 90 durometer rubber with any of the bellow O-ring versions.<br>
    <br>
    Pressure is measured in force per square area. Thus minimizing the O-ring area
    exposed to the high fuel pressure will minimize the forces on the O-ring and in
    turn degradation. The BMW bellow O-rings are not only experiencing ID (inner
    diameter) radial compression set (flattening), they are also experiencing one
    sided axial compression set. This side compression set is an indication of fuel
    entering the bellow O-ring cavity and pressing against the side of the O-ring.
    A normal design round O-ring allows for this, but a custom design O-ring, like
    the BMW bellow O-ring 2 with flat sides, can fill the bellow O-ring cavity
    space and prevent the fuel filling and pressing. Unfortunately BMW used a low
    durometer rubber on the O-ring 2 design and this caused its failure.<br>
    <br>
    Contemporary fuels are blends with ethanol/methanol and this can be corrosive
    to O-ring rubber. Viton is now available in ethanol/methanol resistant
    versions.<br>
    <br>
    An N14/N18 HPFP seals repair kit and associate HPFP tools can be acquired from
    Beisan Systems, <a href="http://www.beisansystems.com">www.beisansystems.com</a>.
    The bellow O-ring is made from Viton, 90 durometer, -40F (-40C) operation,
    ethanol/methanol resistant. The physical design has flat sides with width .02mm
    smaller than the bellow O-ring cavity, and arced ID &amp; OD for compression
    force. The O-ring size is the maximum material fit. The design achieves full
    O-ring cavity fill with maximum rubber compression force. The solenoid O-rings
    are Viton, 80 durometer, -40F (-40C) operation, ethanol/methanol resistant. The
    dome and body O-rings are Viton 80 durometer. The rotary seal is Viton
    durometer 75 and is the same as the original part.<br>
