  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="swing_arm_ball_joints_procedure_files/image001.jpg"><br>
    The swing arm ball joint takes on a much different form than the rest of the
    ball joints found at the end of suspension arms on the E39. The swing arm ball
    joint is an independent component/part. It consists of a center metal
    shaft/pipe and a metal cylindrical sleeve which encircles the shaft outside at
    the approximate shaft center. At the mating point of the two parts, the shaft
    outside morphs into a ball, and the sleeve inside morphs into a socket, and
    thus the ball joint designation. The ball joint is packed in grease, and the
    matting ends are sealed with rubber boots which are mounted with metal O-rings.</p>
  <p><br>
    <img width=512 height=384
src="swing_arm_ball_joints_procedure_files/image002.jpg"><br>
    The ball joint is mounted on the inside of a bore at the bottom rear of the
    rear wheel carrier. The integral link (a shaft like component) connects at the
    front end of the ball joint shaft. The swing arm outboard ends encompass and
    mate with the ball joint and integral link ends. A long bolt runs through (left
    to right, picture) the swing arm, ball joint / wheel carrier, integral link,
    and again swing arm, mounting them all together.<br>
    The ball joint allows a tight connection between the wheel carrier and swing
    arm, while not inhibiting the vertical movements of the wheel carrier.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The ball joint ball and socket matting surfaces
    deteriorate/shrink with use and wear and a space in the joint slowly develops.
    This space creates "play" in the suspension configuration thus changing its
    designed characteristics.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The ball joint rubber boots can also tear, allowing the
    grease to leak out. This will cause friction in the ball joint and
    significantly increase joint wear. The rubber boot is not available separately
    and the ball joint will likely have encountered excessive wear. Thus the
    resolution is to replace the ball joint.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Diagnosis</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Raise rear of car and place on jack stands (use appropriate
    procedure; chock both sides of both front wheels). Release emergency brake and
    place transmission in neutral.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="swing_arm_ball_joints_procedure_files/image003.jpg"><br>
    For each rear wheel perform the following.<br>
    Position yourself on your knees at the wheel. Place one hand on the tire 12
    o"clock inner shoulder, and the other hand on the wheel rim 6 o"clock outer lip.
    Engage your shoulder at the 12 o"clock end. Attempt to push in at the 6 o"clock
    position.<br>
    Note: That's my pastor friend from Syria, 70 years old. Loves working on the
    car!<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Look for play in the wheel movement. This will be a small
    but quick movement, free space. A small incremental movement proportional to
    incremental pressure is normal.<br>
    Note: The ball joint is packed in grease and sometimes that can inhibit the
    "free space" movement, making the diagnosis difficult. The next step is more
    definitive.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="swing_arm_ball_joints_procedure_files/image002.jpg"><br>
    If you find play, have a second person perform the above diagnosis procedure while
    you inspect the ball joint on the wheel inboard side. The ball joint is the
    metal/rubber component that's located at the bottom rear of the wheel carrier. If
    you see one of the rubber boots move, that's an indication of free space in the
    ball joint and thus a faulty joint.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Inspect the ball joints rubber boots for any indication of rubber
    tear and/or grease leak. If any tear or leak is found, the ball joint needs to
    be replaced.<br>
    <br>

  <p><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Preparation</span></u><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>To tighten the integral link bolt (105 Nm) and swing arm bolt/nut
    (256 Nm) at the end of the repair, BMW requires the car be in "empty weight
    position" or "normal position" (i.e. "normal position" optional).<br>
    This method is utilized for most rear end suspension repairs, and is necessary
    to assure the bushing center is locked with the frame (tightened) at a neutral /
    middle of range suspension position. As the suspension maneuvers (up/down), the
    bushing outer sleeve will rotate/torque, but the center shaft will be locked in
    with an independent frame. The middle rubber bushing will consequently be
    twisted/torqued. To attempt to minimize this stress, the bushing center is
    tightened down in a suspension neutral / middle of range position, "empty
    weight position" or "normal position".<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>"Empty weight position" requires the car to be resting on
    all four wheels (level ground), with tires properly inflated, and a full gas
    tank.<br>
    "Normal position" requires, in addition to "empty weight position" requirements,
    that the car be weighed down; specifically: 150lb in each front seat (seat in
    center position), 150lb in center of back seat, 50lb in center of trunk.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Tightening the integral link bolt and swing arm bolt/nut
    with the car on the ground is quite difficult. As an alternative, "empty weight
    position" or "normal position" can be emulated by jacking up the wheel carrier
    to the position achieved by the configuration. Of course to accomplish this,
    the position of the wheel carrier in that configuration, "empty weight
    position" or "normal position", would need to be known in advance.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="swing_arm_ball_joints_procedure_files/image008.jpg"><br>
    Fill car gas tank. Inflate tires to proper pressures. For "normal position",
    load car with 150lb in each front seat (seat in center position), 150lb in
    center of back seat, 50lb in center of trunk; move car to settle suspension.
    Park car on level ground. Note: This is quite important to achieving a proper
    reading.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Remove rear wheels center caps. Measure distance between
    wheel hub center cup bottom lip and fender rim directly above. Verify second
    rear wheel has exact reading. If not, then car may not be on level ground.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>This measurement technique can be replicated when the wheel
    is off the car, which is the practical setup when performing the repair.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Note: On my car, 528i 2000 5sp standard suspension touring
    225/55 R16, the measurement decreased by 1" between the configuration without
    the weights (16 1/2") and then with the weights (15 1/2").<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Repair</span></u><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Raise rear of car and place on jack stands (follow
    appropriate procedure; chock both sides of both front wheels). Remove rear
    wheels. Keep parking brake engaged.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The following procedure shows the left side (driver side).
    The right side is the same but with minor noted differences.<br>
    It's more effective to perform the left side first since it's illustrated with
    pictures.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="swing_arm_ball_joints_procedure_files/image009.jpg"><br>
    As needed in the following two link removal steps, utilize a lift (jack) to
    raise the wheel carrier, easing applied force on link and facilitating bolt
    removal.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="swing_arm_ball_joints_procedure_files/image010.jpg"><br>
    Right side: xenon lights: Disconnect level sensor regulating rod joint. Counter
    hold inside nut and remove outside nut (needle nose pliers, 10mm socket 1/4" / 1/4"
    ratchet). Remove bolt, and rotate regulating rod down.<br>
    Check regulating rod ball joints as described below for stabilizer bar link.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="swing_arm_ball_joints_procedure_files/image011.jpg"><br>
    Disconnect stabilizer bar link joint at swing arm. First, push aside ball joint
    boot from inside nut (flathead). Counter hold inside nut and remove outside nut
    (5/8" [~16mm] combo wrench, 16mm combo wrench). If tool not fitting well on
    inside nut, then repeat boot removal attempt. Inside nut has only two flat
    facets, so outside nut might need to be turned to spin inside nut into a tool
    accessible orientation.<br>
    Remove stabilizer link bolt and rotate link away from swing arm. Pull down on stabilizer
    bar link, or push down on stabilizer bar to facilitate bolt removal.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>This is a good opportunity to check the stabilizer bar link
    ball joints. Twist bolt / link on both ends to rotate ball / socket joints.
    Movement should be stiff. Push/pull each bolt (ball) in/out of link (socket) to
    look for play (free space). There should be no movement. Check link rubber
    boots for tears.<br>
    Any ball joint play (free space) or rubber tear and link needs to be replaced
    (easy to perform at a later time).</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384

  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="swing_arm_ball_joints_procedure_files/image013.jpg"><br>
    Remove swing arm mounting nut. Break nut seize (24mm socket 1/2" / 1/2" breaker
    bar), then counter hold bolt and remove nut (18mm combo wrench, 24mm socket 1/2"
    / 1/2" ratchet).</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="swing_arm_ball_joints_procedure_files/image014.jpg"><br>
    Withdraw swing arm mounting bolt from swing arm front end (car front). Nudge
    bolt tip back (dead blow hammer), or if resistant unscrew from bolt head.
    Unscrew at bolt head for final removal from swing arm front end. Bolt tip will
    now be in integral link, and integral link will have drop down.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="swing_arm_ball_joints_procedure_files/image015.jpg"><br>
    Leverage (pry bar) against axel to press down swing arm front end, and simultaneously
    pull out mounting bolt. Bolt tip will stop at ball joint.<br>
    Unscrew bolt out of ball joint to completely remove (hand).<br>
    Note: Axel can be pulled towards wheel carrier to prevent CV boot contact with
    tool.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="swing_arm_ball_joints_procedure_files/image016.jpg"><br>
    Remove integral link bolt (18mm socket 1/2" / 1/2" breaker bar &amp; 1/2" ratchet).
    Remove integral link from swing arm.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Leverage (pry bar) against axel to push down swing arm, and
    pull up and out" on rotor bottom to detach swing arm and wheel carrier at ball
    joint.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="swing_arm_ball_joints_procedure_files/image017.jpg"><br>
    Leverage (pry bar) against axel to press down on swing arm, and wedge a separator
    (wood block) between axel and swing arm at inboard end of swing arm.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="swing_arm_ball_joints_procedure_files/image018.jpg"><br>
    Lift rotor up and push forward (car front) to further separate wheel carrier
    from swing arm.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="swing_arm_ball_joints_procedure_files/image019.jpg"><br>
    Remove snap ring from ball joint rear end (hammer / chisel, needle-nose
    pliers).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Note: The first owner of my car (00-03) lived in Connecticut, so the ball joint parts were quite oxidized and rusted. The snap rings were
    essentially welded to the wheel carrier.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Clean dirt/rust on ball joint front and rear end outer
    sleeves and wheel carrier bore rim (brake cleaner/towel, sand paper/block).
    Apply lubricant to bore rim (spray lubricant).<br>
    Note: This step minimizes the forces applied on the press tool spindle (bolt)
    and is essential to the proper function and maintenance of the spindle.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Note: When utilizing brake cleaner at car, spray cleaner on
    towel and then clean with towel. This method safeguards from inadvertently
    spraying brake cleaner on car rubber parts which can detrimentally affect them.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Apply grease to press tool spindle (bolt) fine threads (especially
    at spindle end section) (graphite based grease). Also apply grease to press
    tool nut bottom and receive plate center, where nut contacts.<br>
    Note: This step is essential to the proper function and maintenance of the tool.</p>

    Twist press tool small press cap onto ball joint rear end so that it's flush
    with metal sleeve.<br>
    Arrange spindle with receive sleeve (notched cylinder) and plate (notched puck),
    and orient receive sleeve/plate notch to align with wheel carrier protrusion.
    Insert spindle from receive plate through ball joint shaft and thread into
    press cap on other end (8mm combo wrench). Spindle end should protrude from
    press cap end, but not be tightened to press cap. Thread to end then loosen 1/2
    turn.<br>
    Tighten press nut until press cap and receive sleeve are flush with ball joint
    metal sleeve ends (24mm deep socket 1/2" / 1/2" ratchet). Double check all
