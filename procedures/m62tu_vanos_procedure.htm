  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Introduction</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>"Vanos" is BMW's name for its variable valve timing units.
    Vanos units take on various shapes and design according to car year and model
    (engine model). The vanos discussed here is BMW part # 11-36-1-438-694. It's a
    single vanos, meaning only the intake valve timing is varied. This vanos unit
    is part of BMW 8-cylinder engine M62TU. This engine was incorporated in
    multiple car models during years 1999-2005. It's found in the 5-series E39
    99-03, 7-series E38 99-01, X5 E53 99-03, Land Rover 03-05, Range Rover 03-05.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>This vanos has been experiencing a failure. It has been
    diagnosed that the failure is due to deterioration of the vanos seals. The
    vanos seals encompass an O-ring at the outer perimeter of the vanos plastic
    housing and a dynamic rod seal at the inner perimeter of the same plastic
    housing.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The vanos plastic housing outer perimeter O-ring is made of
    Viton, the correct material, but is experiencing compression set (flattening)
    over time and use and is failing in its function.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The vanos plastic housing inner perimeter rod seal is made
    of a Teflon ring and backing O-ring. "The Teflon ring is made from pigment modified
    (turquoise) Teflon. This slight variation on virgin Teflon is slightly more
    resistant to wear and deformation than virgin Teflon. But it is still is very
    susceptible to wear and deformation. The Teflon ring has been found to lose
    significant material due to wear. This loss of material is causing the Teflon
    ring to lose its functional characteristics and thus cause the vanos to fail.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The rod seal O-ring is made from Viton, the correct material
    for the application, but is experiencing notable compression set (flattening).
    This compression set further reduces the seal material fill in the seal cavity
    and thus further compounds the Teflon ring material wear failure. Thus
    replacing the O-ring is appropriate when replacing the Teflon ring.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>BMW has been engaged regarding other vanos failures in the
    past but has elected to not address the issues, "No further development will be
    done". New vanos units are being sold with the same pigment modified Teflon
    ring. BMW does not provide the vanos rod seal as a separate part.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Due to the sealed nature of this vanos the plastic housing
    outer perimeter O-ring can"t be accessed and replaced. Fortunately a method was
    found to slightly modify the vanos to circumvent the function for this O-ring
    and thus the need to replace it. The vanos top lip is pressed down onto the
    plastic housing to press the plastic housing down and seat it on a vanos wall shelf.
    This seating creates a functional oil seal that provides the oil chamber seal
    the O-ring was intended to achieve.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The rod seal Teflon ring can be replaced with a Teflon ring
    made from a very low friction Teflon compound but one that has significantly
    better resistance to wear and deformation. A low friction coefficient is
    necessary for this application due to the low engine oil pressure and the large
    rotary vanos movement. To achieve such low friction and low wear properties simultaneously
    requires special Teflon materials that are not readily available from seals
    companies. A special high grade Teflon carbon filler is available for such an
    application. This filler is used on the i6 vanos OEM Teflon rings and has been
    used by Beisan for the replacement Teflon rings for the i6 vanos units for some
    time. This special material is appropriate for this vanos application. The
    Teflon ring is not a standard part and needs to be semi-custom manufactured.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Viton material O-rings have variations in characteristics.
    The Beisan sourced Viton O-rings have been shown over time to have excellent
    compression set characteristics. Thus the rod seal O-ring is replaced with this
    Viton material O-ring.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>This vanos has one rod seal comprised of a Teflon ring and
    O-ring. There are two vanos units per engine, one for each engine head.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>A vanos seals/O-rings repair kit can be acquired through
    Beisan Systems (bee-saan), <a href="http://www.beisansystems.com/products">www.beisansystems.com/products</a>.
    It includes a vanos replacement set of high grade carbon Teflon rings and Viton
    O-rings. The kit also includes two O-rings for the secondary air pipe, two
    O-rings for the two camshaft chain tensioners, and 4 O-rings for the two engine
    covers two mounting bolt shafts. These extra O-rings are needed during the
    vanos seals repair and are provided as a value-add to the kit.<br>
    A vanos press tool is also available from Beisan Systems to press the vanos lip
    to overcome the need to replace the inaccessible plastic housing outer perimeter
    O-ring.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Symptoms</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Cold start vanos rattle.<br>
    Warm idle vanos clatter, similar to diesel engine.<br>
    Loss of low end torque/power and uneven power delivery.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Diagnosis</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The failure symptoms can be relied on for the diagnosis. The
    cold start rattle is the initial indication, and is then flowed by the warm
    idle clatter.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Vanos Components<br>
    <br>
    </span></b></p>
  <p>This vanos system (variable valve timing) is made of
    multiple components. Further, the main vanos unit is friction welded as one
    part with an insert shaft and thus cannot be easily assessed. This section
    attempts to describe the system components and provide a breakdown of the vanos
    unit parts.<br>
    <br>
    Oil feed to the system comes through a hole in the engine head front. A check
    valve is installed into this hole to prevent oil reverse leakage. This keeps
    the vanos oil chambers from leaking when the engine is turned off. An oil
    distribution piece is mounted at the engine head front over the oil feed hole and
    provides oil distribution paths to the vanos front and rear oil chambers and
    oil drain. A solenoid with valves mounts into the oil distribution piece and onto
    the oil feed check valve. The solenoid with valves provides a two position
    system. The vanos front oil chamber is pressurized with oil and the vanos rear
    oil chamber is drained of oil, or the reverse. The solenoid is driven by a PMW
    (pulse width modulation) signal which modulates the solenoid and valves between
    the two positions. The oil distribution piece also mounts over the camshaft and
    routs the oil paths through the camshaft. The vanos center shaft mounts inside
    of the camshaft and completes routing the oil paths to their final destination vanos
    oil chambers. The vanos center shaft rotates with the camshaft for timing
    adjustment while the vanos main body (sprockets) slides on the vanos center
    shaft during timing adjustment.<br>
    <br>
    The following pictures show the vanos cut open and disassembled then piecemeal
    reassembled to show its parts.</p>
  <p><img border=0 width=512 height=384
src="m62tu_vanos_procedure_files/image001.jpg"><br>
    The vanos incorporates the intake camshaft sprockets.<br>
    Internally it's a cylinder with polished wall and a center cylinder shaft with
    helical gears on the outer diameter and polished wall on the inner diameter.<br>
    Holes in the cylinder shaft provide an oil path to the vanos rear oil chamber.<br>
    A shelf on the cylinder inner wall provides a stop/seating position for the
    plastic housing (three pictures below).</p>

    A piston with center cylinder shaft with helical gears on the inner and outer
    diameter inserts onto the vanos center cylinder shaft and mates the helical
    gears.<br>
    A steel ring inserts into the piston outer perimeter groove and acts as a
    dynamic seal.<br>
    The vanos body and piston create an oil chamber at the rear of the piston.</p>
  <p><img border=0 width=512 height=384

  <p><img border=0 width=512 height=384
src="m62tu_vanos_procedure_files/image005.jpg"><br>
    A plastic housing with O-ring and Teflon ring in an inner perimeter groove and
    a small O-ring in an outer perimeter groove mounts at the front of the vanos.<br>
    The vanos body, piston, and plastic housing create an oil chamber at the front
    of the piston.</p>
  <p><img border=0 width=512 height=384
src="m62tu_vanos_procedure_files/image006.jpg"><br>
    A washer installs at the piston inner diameter and acts as a bearing surface
    for the shaft (next pictures) to rotate on.<br>
    The washer also acts as the piston shaft inner diameter dynamic seal.</p>
  <p><img border=0 width=512 height=384

  <p><img border=0 width=512 height=384
src="m62tu_vanos_procedure_files/image008.jpg"><br>
    A shaft with cup with helical gears on the cup inner side mounts through the
    center of the vanos.<br>
    The cup helical gears mate with the piston outer helical gears.<br>
    The cup outer perimeter mates with the plastic housing O-ring and Teflon ring and
    seals the front oil chamber.</p>
  <p><img border=0 width=512 height=384
src="m62tu_vanos_procedure_files/image009.jpg"><br>
    The shaft protrudes through the rear of the vanos and mounts inside of the
    camshaft.<br>
    The shaft mounts the vanos onto the intake camshaft while allowing the shaft
    and camshaft to rotate independently of the vanos. This is needed for the
    timing adjustment.<br>
    Oil passages flow through the camshaft to the vanos center shaft to the vanos
    two oil chambers.<br>

    creates excess play and allows T55 torx bit to tilt. An effective solution is
    to lengthen a 1.5 ft 3/8" breaker bar. A 1 ft x 1&quot; diameter gas pipe works
    well for this application. Insert pipe ~1/2 length onto breaker bar and tape
    onto breaker bar with duct tape (picture).</p>

    In following step seal Teflon ring will be inserted into plastic housing seal
    cavity.<br>
    Above pictures show two techniques needed to assure correct insertion.<br>
    While inserting Teflon ring into vanos, pull up on inserted section at center
    point and insert into seal cavity and seat over O-ring (combination pick).<br>
    Note: Teflon ring will need to be bent some at transition point from exposed to
    inserted section to accomplish insertion into seal cavity.<br>
    Teflon ring insertion and seating over O-ring in seal cavity can be verified by
    checking for space between Teflon ring top and seal cavity top. (combination
    pick) (pictures). There should be no space between Teflon ring top and seal
    cavity top.<br>
    Note: Second picture above shows Teflon ring not seated correctly over O-ring
    and space found between Teflon ring top and seal cavity top. Last picture above
    shows Teflon ring seated correctly over O-ring and no space found between
    Teflon ring top and seal cavity top.<br>
    <br>
    Note: Above pictures are taken with vanos piston removed to allow for direct
    view. This cannot be performed without cutting vanos open.</p>

    Insert all inserted Teflon ring into seal cavity while pressing incrementally
    on exposed Teflon ring.<br>
    Press in exposed Teflon ring until it notably bends at sides. This Teflon ring
    deformation is needed to keep Teflon ring from popping back out of vanos.<br>

    Press in and down on exposed Teflon ring at different locations (90 degree
    pick) to insert exposed Teflon ring to inside of plastic housing (picture).<br>
    Teflon ring will deform in process and multiple waves will develop in Teflon
    ring shape.<br>
    <br>

    If Teflon ring is damaged due to wrong insertion, it can be mostly rectified by
    mounting it on vanos shaft sealing surface at cup rim (picture).<br>
    Heating Teflon ring (heat gun or hair dryer) and pressing in (90 degree pick)
    at center of damaged Teflon ring can further rectify damage.<br>

    Press exposed Teflon ring in and down (90 degree pick). This allows Teflon ring
    bottom edge to go past O-ring and for Teflon ring to seat on O-ring in seal
    cavity.<br>
    Perform Teflon ring insertion from sides of unseated Teflon ring. This allows a
    progression of Teflon ring seating on O-ring in seal cavity.<br>

    Preform pressing at multiple locations multiple times.<br>
    Once Teflon ring waves dampen, begin to smooth Teflon ring by pressing along
    wrinkled section from end to end (90 degree pick).<br>
    Continue to press along Teflon ring wrinkled section until much of wrinkles are
    smoothed. Moderate force is needed at end of smoothing process for effective
    results.<br>
    Note: It is not necessary to fully smooth Teflon ring surface. This will occur
    once Teflon ring is exposed to engine temperature and vanos is exercised.</p>

  <p><u>Pressing of vanos lip</u><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>During following procedure vanos lip will be pressed down
    onto vanos plastic housing to fully seat plastic housing bottom onto vanos wall
    shelf below plastic housing. Seating of plastic housing creates functional oil
    seal between plastic housing and shelf. This seal circumvents function of
    plastic housing failing outer O-ring and thus need to replace it, which is not
    practical.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Press vanos piston fully into vanos.<br>
    Vanos center washer can be present or removed from vanos during following
    procedure. If present, washer should be fully pressed onto vanos and should not
    protrude past piston.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>If present, clean oil sludge from vanos plastic housing
    (brake cleaner &amp; towels).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>As needed clean press tool and remove previous alignment
    marks from press bolt and press washer (brake cleaner &amp; towels).<br>

    Press down plastic housing into vanos at multiple locations (medium flathead).<br>
    Plastic housing will seat on vanos wall shelf below housing and ~.9mm space

    In following steps press tool press cap will be pressed onto vanos lip to press
    lip down onto plastic housing. It is useful to understand press cap inner side
    design which facilitates this press function.<br>
    A press cap wall functions to support vanos wall top to keep it from collapsing
    to outside when lip is pressed. A wall initial 2mm barrel chamfer allows
    initial alignment and seating of press cap on vanos.<br>
    Indentation of press cap along perimeter allows space for vanos wall to insert
    into indentation and not be pressed. Only inner edge of vanos lip is pressed.
    This allows best leverage and thus easiest press.<br>
    Three holes in press cap allow vanos test pins to insert into holes and avoid
    being pressed down. Holes outer edge aligns with pins outer edge. Holes cannot
    be aligned further out as press shelf at pins would be removed.<br>
    An inner indentation prevents press cap from pressing against vanos center
    piston.</p>
