(E9X M3, E60 M5)</span></b><br>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Introduction</span></b><br>
<br>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An automotive throttle actuator is an electromechanical
device that actuates (positions) the opening of an engine throttle. An engine
throttle is a valve that controls the air intake into the engine. A throttle is
normally a spring loaded, default position closed, butterfly valve. The S65/S85
engine has 8/10 cylinders and is a V engine. Thus there are two engine head
banks with each having 4/5 cylinders. Each cylinder has a dedicated throttle. Thus
each bank has 4/5 throttles. These 4/5 throttles are controlled simultaneously
by a single mechanical rail that controls their position identically. Each
throttle rail, with row of 4/5 throttles, is controlled by a single throttle
actuator. Therefore there are 2 throttle actuators, one for each engine bank.<br>
<br>
The S65/S85 throttle actuator is an intelligent device with a microcontroller,
which includes microprocessor, RAM, and ROM. It is connected to a CAN (controller
area network) bus and communicates with the DME (digital motor electronics,
engine computer) for throttle opening position commands. It also connects to
two throttle position sensors, one at each end of the throttle rail, which
provide throttle opening position data for feedback control. The throttle
actuator incorporates a DC (direct current) brush motor and two stepdown gears
for throttle opening physical control. The DC motor is driven by 2 sets of
transistor banks, each consisting of 2 power transistors connected in series,
to drive the motor rotationally and counter rotationally. A PWM (pulse width
modulation) signal is used to drive the motor. A PWM signal is a square wave.
The high pulse turns the motor rotationally, and the low pulse turns the motor
counter rotationally. The frequency (cycle time) of the PWM signal is
undocumented. Modulation (changing) of the PWM (square wave) signal duty cycle (length
of the pulses) controls the rotational / counter rotational position of the
motor and in turn the throttle rail and throttles open position.<br>
<br>
The S65/S85 throttle actuator experiences multiple failures and has an expected
life of ~70k miles.<br>
<br>
A primary failure of the throttle actuator is wearing step down plastic gear
teeth. The gears are made from PPA (Polyphthalamide) plastic with fillers. The
combination of load from the throttle springs and vibration from the engine
causes the plastic gears teeth to press on each other with high force and rub.
This high force contact and rubbing movement causes significant gear teeth wear
and eventual gear function failure.<br>
<br>
One of the two primary throttle actuator electronic failures is the PC (printed
circuit) board voltage regulator IC (integrated circuit, chip), which provides board
input voltage level stabilization (normalization). This voltage regulator IC is
a problematic part which degrades and eventually fails. It causes relative slow
function of the throttle actuator as it degrades, and full throttle actuator failure
once it fully fails. It can also cause the EEPROM and CAN bus driver power transistor
to fail.<br>
<br>
The second primary electronics failure is the PC board DC motor driving power
transistors. The transistors failure is due to high voltage spikes from the DC
motor that occur when the motor driving polarity is reversed by the PWM signal,
ie rotation / counter rotation reversal. The throttle actuator has circuity to dampen
the voltage spikes. This includes a large capacitor located under the plastic
cover bulge on the outer side of the throttle actuator cover. Although the circuity
and capacitor are sufficient to protect the power transistors during "normal"
function, the voltage spikes from the motor increase beyond the capabilities of
the circuitry and capacitor and this exposes the transistors to voltage spikes
that eventually cause them to fail. The cause of the higher voltage spikes is buildup
of carbon dust from wearing motor brushes that interferes with the contact of
the motor brushes to the motor commutator and increases the contact resistance.<br>
<br>
A more rare failure is DC motor internal brush housing plastic melting. This
occurs from high heat generated from brush carbon dust buildup and electricity.
When this occurs, the DC motor can malfunction. If a PC board lead DC motor
power transistor is darkened (burnt out), then there is a chance that DC motor brush
housing plastic melting has occurred.<br>
<br>
Lastly, the DC motor brushes wear and are not replaceable. But indications are
the brushes wear slowly and will last the lifespan of the car.<br>
<br>
New throttle actuator gears with shaft can be acquired from Beisan System, <a
href="http://www.beisansystems.com">www.beisansystems.com</a>. The gears are
made from powder metal steel that is sintered and hardened to 55 HRC (bearing
steel hardness). They have a surface alloy finish from tempering that deters
rusting. The half gear has a pressed in stainless steel shaft that is hardened
to 50 HRC and has a ground surface finish. The gears" hardened steel is over
engineered for the throttle actuator application, and thus the gear teeth should
never wear. The stainless steel shaft is made from the same stainless steel,
and is hardened to the same hardness, as the OE (original equipment) shaft, and
should never wear.<br>
<br>
A throttle actuator electronics rebuild service is provided by Bimmer Throttle
Repair, <a href="http://www.bimmerthrottlerepair.com">www.bimmerthrottlerepair.com</a>.
The following tests and repairs are performed. The DC motor driving 4 power
transistors are replaced with new OE (original equipment) transistors. The
voltage regulator is replaced with a new redesigned version of the OE voltage
regulator that addresses the degradation and failure. The rebuilt electronics
are then tested and assessed on an S65 engine test bed. If the EEPROM is
failed, it is replaced with a new OE EEPROM. If the CAN bus transistor is
failed, it is replaced with a new OE CAN bus transistor. These repairs and
tests and further repairs address 99.9% of electronics failures. If the
electronics are still not functioning after the repairs, the customer is
contacted and offered replacement rebuilt electronics for an additional $70.<br>
<br>
This procedure shows how to clean the DC motor to remove the brush carbon dust
and prevent the PC board power transistors from failing and brushes plastic
housing from melting. It also shows how to test the motor continuity to check
for internal melted brushes housing plastic. The DC motor brush length is also inspected
to estimate the remaining life of the brushes and motor.<br>
<br>
The throttle actuator DC motor will need to be cleaned every 60k miles (100k
km) to remove the brushes carbon dust buildup and prevent potential damage to
the PC board DC motor power transistors and DC motor brushes plastic housing.<br>

Turn DC motor gear slowly and note digital multimeter ohm reading.<br>
Reading will fluctuate as gear is turned.<br>

If DC motor resistance reading is high, then DC motor likely has internal

Open caliper jaws, then place caliper end extending rod on brush end and push

brush end depth from motor housing.<br>
Subtract 4.5mm from measured depth value to remove motor housing thickness

Remaining depth value is brush length wear.<br>
<br>
Carbon brush length when new is 10mm.<br>

Small 8 pin IC adjacent to voltage regulator is EEPROM (picture just left and
