    <br>
  </p>
  <p>BMW introduced its first variable valve timing systems in
    93. It called its variable valve timing unit “vanos”. On the standard i6 engine
    this was a single vanos (intake adjustment) and was initially introduced on car
    models E36 320i/325i and E34 520i/525i. BMW soon realized its variable valve
    timing system was prone to a rattle. It modified the system to incorporate a
    diaphragm spring on the intake camshaft sprocket. The diaphragm spring dampens
    sprocket rotational play and thus reduces the rattle. This diaphragm spring
    design was incorporated in all subsequent standard i6 single vanos car models,
    except the Euro 328i. On March 95 build the diaphragm spring design was
    introduced on the E36 320i/325i/Euro 328i and E34 520i/525i.<br>
    This diaphragm spring design can be retrofitted onto pre March 95 build E36 320i/325i/Euro
    328i and E34 520i/525i cars. This retrofit can significantly reduce the variable
    valve timing system rattle.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><u>Technical background</u><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>To understand the function of the diaphragm spring for
    reducing the rattle some understanding of the BMW variable valve timing system
    is needed.<br>
    <br>
    Variable valve timing is the modifying of the engine valve opening/closing
    timing dynamically. BMW’s variable valve timing implements a time shift (phase
    shift) scheme. The camshaft cam is not modified, thus all the characteristics
    of the opening and closing of the valve remain the same. What changes is the
    time when the valve opening/closing occurs relative to the crankshaft timing.
    The camshaft relative rotational position to the crankshaft is modified
    (shifted). Advancing (clockwise) the camshaft advances (earlier) the valve
    timing (opening/closing) relative to the crankshaft. Retarding (counter
    clockwise) the camshaft retards (later) the valve timing (opening/closing)
    relative to the crankshaft.<br>
    Helical (slanted) gears are utilized to physically implement this mechanism.
    Due to their nature, helical gears require a rotation to insert onto each
    other. This characteristic of helical gears is utilized to implement the
    relative rotation of the camshaft to the crankshaft dynamically while the
    engine is running.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>[picture]<br>
    The camshaft and camshaft sprocket are not mounted directly to each other. The
    sprocket has a hole at its middle that’s larger than the camshaft end. Opposing
    slant helical gears are mounted at the sprocket hole and camshaft end. There is
    an independent splined shaft with a cup and helical gears on the inside and
    outside of the cup walls. The splined shaft cup inner helical gears match the
    camshaft helical gears and the splined shaft cup outer helical gears match the
    sprocket helical gears. The splined shaft cup is inserted onto and mates with
    the camshaft and sprocket helical gears. Thus the splined shaft connects the
    camshaft and sprocket. Inserting and withdrawing the splined shaft axially
    in/out of the camshaft and sprocket requires the rotation of a component due to
    the helical gears. The sprocket rotation is fixed by the timing chain. The
    splined shaft can’t rotate due to the opposing helical gear slants on its cup
    inside and outside. Thus it’s the camshaft that rotates when the splined shaft
    is manipulated axially.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>[picture]<br>
    Inserting the splined shaft axially onto the camshaft and sprocket causes the
    camshaft to advance (rotate clockwise) and cause advanced (earlier) timing.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>[picture]<br>
    Withdrawing the splined shaft axially from the camshaft and sprocket causes the
    camshaft to retard (rotate counter clockwise) and cause retarded (later)
    timing.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The vanos is a hydraulic actuator. Its function is to
    dynamically position the splined shaft axially to cause camshaft advance or
    retard rotation which enacts variable valve timing.<br>
    The vanos utilizes two cylinders and a piston. There is an oil chamber at the
    fore and aft of the piston. Controlling the oil pressure in the two oil
    chambers manipulates the axial position of the piston. Seals on the piston
    allow the piston to reciprocate axially along the cylinder walls while
    maintaining a tight oil seal on the two oil chamber. The splined shaft is
    mounted to the vanos piston. Thus manipulating the axial position of the piston
    also manipulates the axial position of the splined shaft. The piston has a
    bearing at its center. The splined shaft is mounted to this bearing. The piston
    bearing allows the splined shaft to rotate with the camshaft and sprocket while
    not rotating the piston.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="single_vanos_diaphragm_spring_procedure_files/image001.jpg"><br>
    On a non variable valve timing engine the camshaft sprocket is mounted directly
    to the camshaft. As noted above with the BMW variable valve timing system the
    sprocket is connected to the camshaft via the splined shaft. But this is not
    sufficient to fully support the sprocket. BMW devised a method to mount the
    sprocket on the camshaft but still allow the camshaft to rotate independent of
    the sprocket for variable valve timing adjustment.<br>
    The camshaft has three dowels protruding axially and the sprocket has three
    slots along its face. The sprocket slots are inserted onto the camshaft dowels.
    When the camshaft is rotated for timing adjustment the camshaft dowels slide
    along the sprocket slots. This allows the camshaft to rotate independent of the
    sprocket.<br>
    To maintain the sprocket on the camshaft dowels, stop disks are mounted at the
    fore and aft of the sprocket. These stop disks are fully mounted on the
    camshaft dowels and rotate with the camshaft. During camshaft timing adjustment
    the stop disk faces slide along the sprocket faces.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><u>Cause of rattle<br>
    <br>
    </u></p>
  <p>Due to the nature of helical gears, not only does the axial
    positioning of the splined shaft cause the rotation of the camshaft, but also
    reciprocally the rotation of the camshaft causes the axial positioning of the
    splined shaft.<br>
    Over time and use the helical gears on the camshaft, sprocket, and splined
    shaft develop wear along the gear spline side contact surfaces. This wear
    creates excessive play between the helical gears. This causes excessive play in
    the fit of the splined shaft to the camshaft and sprocket. This manifests in
    axial play between the splined shaft and camshaft and sprocket.<br>
    As the camshaft rotates the cam nose rolls onto the valve seat and compresses
    the valve spring to open the valve and rolls off the valve seat and
    decompresses the valve spring to close the valve. The resistance force of the
    valve spring compression creates an opposing force to the forward rotation of
    the camshaft. The recoiling force of the valve spring decompression creates an
    additive force to the forward rotation of the camshaft.<br>
    Due to the splined shaft axial play, as the cam compresses the valve spring the
    camshaft will slightly retard in relative rotation to the crankshaft and as the
    cam decompresses the valve spring the camshaft will slightly advance in
    relative rotation to the crankshaft. These movements of the camshaft are due to
    camshaft least resistance path of movement. Due to the splined shaft axial play
    there is less resistance to the camshaft retarding than compressing the spring
    and less resistance to the camshaft advancing than containing the decompressing
    spring. These movements manifest into camshaft lashes which engage the splined
    shaft axially. The greater the helical gear wear the greater the splined shaft
    axial play the stronger the camshaft lashes.<br>
    At certain engine RPMs these camshaft movements resonate. This causes stronger
    camshaft lashes which cause more powerful engagements of the splined shaft
    axially. This causes strong axial movements of the splined shaft. Any axial
    play in the splined shaft vicinity is engaged and can cause a rattle.<br>
    There are two locations of axial play. The helical gears themselves have axial
    play that’s engaged and rattles and the vanos piston bearing has axial play
    that’s engaged and rattles.<br>
    <br>
    The splined shaft axial movements caused by the camshaft lashes are facilitated
    by the helical gear wear, but they are also enhanced by sprocket rotational
    play.<br>
    The sprocket is mounted rotationally by the splined shaft and timing chain. The
    splined shaft and sprocket helical gears wear and create play as noted above. Also
    the timing chain has excess length. The helical gear play and timing chain
    excess length combine to create sprocket rotational play.<br>
    When the camshaft lash moves the splined shaft axially the splined shaft also
    engages the sprocket. Due to the sprocket rotational play the splined shaft
    axial movement causes to rotate the sprocket. This allows the splined shaft to
    have longer axial movements. These longer movements enhance the effect of the
    camshaft lashes on the splined shaft. The splined shaft axial movements become
    stronger and more able to engage associate components play and cause it to
    rattle.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><u>Diaphragm spring rattle solution</u><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>In an attempt to reduce the rattle BMW introduced a
    diaphragm spring that improves the sprocket mount and dampens its rotational
    play.<br>
    The diaphragm spring is included as part of the camshaft sprocket apparatus. In
    addition to the sprocket outer stop disk, a diaphragm spring (concave plate) followed
    by an additional stop disk are installed. When the last outer stop disk is
    mounted on the camshaft dowels the diaphragm spring is compressed. This causes
    to press the stop disks on the fore and aft of the sprocket onto the sprocket
    faces. This creates resistance to sprocket rotation and dampens sprocket
    rotational play movements. This acts to inhibit splined shaft axial movements
    and in turn reduces the rattle.<br>
    The diaphragm spring force is not excessive and thus still allows the sliding
    of the stop disk faces along the sprocket faces during camshaft timing
    adjustment.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><u>Diaphragm spring retrofit</u><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Pre March 95 build E36 320i/325i/Euro 328i and E34 520i/525i
    cars can retrofit install the diaphragm spring. To do this the existing
    camshaft dowels are replaced with longer dowels and the sprocket outer stop
    disk is replaced with a stop disk, diaphragm spring, and stop disk.<br>
    The needed parts are available from BMW and are listed in this repair
