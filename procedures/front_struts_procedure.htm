    provided for reference purposes only and should be used at your own risk<br>

  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Introduction</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The E39 comes equipped with OEM Sachs struts/shocks,
    springs, and associated components. Sachs suggests the lifespan of their
    struts/shocks is 70k-120k miles. Sachs says cold weather and bad road
    conditions are the primary contributors to accelerated strut/shock
    deterioration. Sachs BMW struts and shocks are made in Germany. The Sachs parts BMW sells and the ones sold on the open market are identical,
    except for the part numbers. Sachs provides a lifetime ("defective or worn-out")
    warranty on their struts/shocks. This is available through third party vendors,
    but not through BMW.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The following is a short discussion on front struts failure
    symptoms and diagnosis, and an E39 Sachs front struts R&amp;R (remove and
    replace) procedure.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Symptoms</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Initially, the front struts will squeak and have an extra
    bounce on speed bumps. Within a month this will transition to the car landing
    hard on speed bumps and the suspension feeling stiff on road bumps. A loss of
    control can also be felt during and after excessively bumpy road conditions.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Over time failing struts can cause inner tire tread cupping
    and wear.<br>
    Badly worn struts can leak lubricating oil.<br>
    If the spring pads are badly worn, a clunk could be heard when landing from a speed
    bump.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Diagnosis</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>There is no practical DIY diagnosis for struts/shocks.
    Paying attention to the symptoms is sufficient to characterizing the failure.
    If one end of the car is presenting with failure symptoms, then it's likely the
    other end is not far behind.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Repair Procedure</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The following is an E39 Sachs front struts R&amp;R (remove
    and replace) procedure.<br>
    A wheel alignment should be performed after the repair.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Repair time ~8 hours.<br>

    Remove Brake caliper carrier to wheel carrier 2 mounting bolts (18mm socket 1/2"
    / 1/2" breaker bar &amp; ratchet).</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="front_struts_procedure_files/image007.jpg"><br>
    Remove caliper carrier from wheel carrier. Slightly pry caliper open at brake
    pad only as needed to facilitate removal (flathead).<br>
    Note: Do not over expand caliper as this will place possibly damaging pressure
    on system.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="front_struts_procedure_files/image008.jpg"><br>
    Tie caliper carrier onto brake fluid pipe (rope).</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384

    Right side: xenon lights: Disconnect level sensor regulating rod joint. Counter
    hold inside nut and remove outside nut (needle nose pliers, 10mm socket 1/4" / 1/4"
    ratchet). Remove bolt and rotate regulating rod (link) to be adjacent with control
    arm.<br>
    Check regulating rod ball joints as described below for stabilizer bar link.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="front_struts_procedure_files/image010.jpg"><br>
    Disconnect stabilizer bar link joint at stabilizer bar. First, push aside ball
    joint boot from inside nut (flathead). Counter hold inside nut and remove
    outside nut (16mm combo wrench, 16mm socket 1/2" / 1/2" ratchet). If tool not
    fitting well on inside nut, then repeat boot removal attempt. Inside nut has
    only two flat facets, so outside nut might need to be turned to spin inside nut
    into a tool accessible orientation.<br>
    Remove stabilizer link bolt and rotate link to be adjacent with wheel carrier.<br>
    Note: Adjust stabilizer bar and link as needed to facilitate bolt removal.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>This is a good opportunity to check the stabilizer bar link
    ball joints. Twist bolt / link on both ends to rotate ball / socket joints.
    Movement should be stiff. Push/pull each bolt (ball) in/out of link (socket) to
    look for play (free space). There should be no movement. Check link rubber
    boots for tears, especially at base seam.<br>
    Any ball joint play (free space) or rubber tear and link needs to be replaced
    (easy to perform at a later time).</p>

  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="front_struts_procedure_files/image012.jpg"><br>
    Remove tie-rod bolt from wheel carrier (BMW ball joint remover, 24mm combo
    wrench). Apply lubricant to outer/leverage spindle (graphite based grease).
    Screw in (clockwise) outer/leverage spindle, leaving ~1/2" of thread. Adjust
    inner/fitting spindle to facilitate good fit between lower wheel carrier shelf and
    tie-rod bolt end. Insert/twist lower tool arm fork completely under tie-rod
    ball joint boot. Place upper tool arm press cup on top of tie-rod bolt end;
    Insert arm as far in as possible. Adjust fitting spindle as necessary. Tighten
    leverage spindle to hold tool in place (24mm combo wrench).<br>
    Tighten leverage spindle to press tie-rod bolt out of wheel carrier shelf (24mm
    combo wrench). There will be a "big bang" when bolt releases, and tools will
    drop to ground. Be careful!!<br>
    Note: It's helpful to protect ears from shock (ear plugs).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>8-cyl: Turn steering wheel to opposite side to facilitate
    space for tie-rod ball joint to drop out of wheel carrier.<br>
    <br>

    Remove strut plastic center cap (flathead) at strut tower (under hood).<br>
    Remove strut mount 3 nuts at strut tower (13mm socket 1/4" / 1/4" ratchet &amp;
    socket extension).<br>
    Remove filter box spring clip at strut tower and partially lift filter box assy
    to allow easier removal of rear nut.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="front_struts_procedure_files/image016.jpg"><br>
    Optional: Insert bar into wheel hub center for foot leverage (long socket
    extension 1/2").<br>
    Note: Verify ABS/speed and brake pad sensor cables have enough slack to allow
    for wheel carrier lowering in next steps.<br>
    Position tie-rod to side of wheel carrier.<br>
    Optional: Turn steering wheel, 6-cyl to opposite side, 8-cyl to work side,
    causing tie-rod to be drawn in to car inboard.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Press down on wheel hub with foot while holding onto spring
    coils with hands. Lower strut assy top out of strut tower and pull into outer wheel
    well.<br>
    Note: Allow strut assy top to lower strait out of tower first before pulling
    into outer wheel well. Otherwise strut assy will hook onto wheel well liner and
    become difficult to extract.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Press down again with foot, tilt strut assy top to rear ~10",
    lower strut assy, and slowly lean strut assy top out of wheel well.<br>
    Note: Allow strut assy top to lower away from fender rim before pulling out of
    wheel well. Otherwise strut assy will hook onto fender inner rim and become
    difficult to extract.<br>
    Note: Do not use heavy force. If strut assy is not clearing rim, stop, and
    reconsider components positioning.</p>

    Remove strut from wheel carrier. Lubricate wheel carrier bearing top and bottom
    at strut (spray lubricant). Wait a few minutes for lubricant to take effect.<br>
    Pry open wheel carrier bearing (flathead), while simultaneously twisting spring
    coil and pulling up on strut.</p>

    <br>
  </p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Replacement of strut</span></u><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Clean spring thoroughly (glass cleaner / towels). There
    should be no debris or grease on spring when done; clean and dry.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Coat both spring press spindle (bolt) threads with grease lubricant
    (graphite based grease). Also coat both spindle heads clasp contact surfaces.<br>
    Note: This is essential for proper function and maintenance of tool.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Clean spring press clasps (coil seats) (brake cleaner / towels).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Lay strut assy down horizontally (floor pad). Place a spring
    press at each side of spring, and alternate spring press directions so there is
    a spindle head at each spring seat.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="front_struts_procedure_files/image020.jpg"><br>
    Working with spring press with spindle head at upper spring seat (strut mount
    seat), place spring press head clasp on coil as far to end of spring as
    possible. Jar spring press clasp a few times to push further to end on spring (dead
    blow hammer). Clasp should be just below spring end tip.<br>
    Place spring press tail clasp on spring two coils away, keeping spindle strait on
    strut axis.<br>
    Tighten spindle to maintain clasps positions.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="front_struts_procedure_files/image021.jpg"><br>
    Perform same as above with second spring press. A notch in lower spring seat (strut
    perch) facilitates positioning spring press head clasp further to end of spring.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="front_struts_procedure_files/image022.jpg"><br>
    Spring presses need to be as far on opposite sides of spring as possible. This
    will help keep spring presses from slipping during press process.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>It's now important to take close note of the positioning of
    the spring in the strut assy. Understanding this will be essential for proper
    reassembly. The spring lower coil is molded to fit the lower seat (strut perch)
    egg shape and is positioned on the lower seat to fit that outline. The position
    of the spring lower tip is of no specific relevance. The strut mount is then positioned
    so that its notch indentation mates with the spring upper tip.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Optional: Place a mark on the spring lower coil at the perch
    nose tip to provide an orientation reference for reinstallation (paint).</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="front_struts_procedure_files/image023.jpg"><br>
    Note: It's best to have strut horizontal when performing press process (floor
    pad).<br>
    Tighten spindles (3/4" socket 1/2" / 1/2" ratchet), rotating often between
    spindles. Maintaining proportional spindle clasp to clasp lengths is essential
    to keeping a spring press from sliding. A spring press sliding out of position
    will cause significant complications. Rotate often and be careful not to jar spring
    presses.<br>
    Spring press with spindle head at upper spring seat will need open face tool on
    last 1/3 of press process due to spindle head proximity to seat (3/4" combo
    wrench).<br>
    Spring coils need to be pressed until almost touching. Press process is
    complete when spring has some play between upper and lower seats.</p>
