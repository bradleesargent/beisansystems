  <p>"Vanos" is BMW"s name for its variable valve timing units.
    Vanos units take on various shapes and design according to car year and model
    (engine model). The vanos discussed here is BMW part # 11-31-1-402-428. It"s a single
    vanos; meaning only the intake valve timing is varied. This vanos unit is part
    of BMW 6-cylinder engine Euro S50B30. This engine was incorporated into one car
    model, the 3-series Euro E36 M3 93-95.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>This vanos, like most vanos designs, can develop a rattle.
    The vanos rattle is caused by wear in the variable valve timing helical
    (slanted) gears. These gears are found on the camshaft sprocket and splined
    shaft, which attaches to the vanos. The helical gear wear allows the camshaft
    to have lash movements that engage the splined shaft axially. At certain RPMs
    these movements resonate and engage axial play (free space) and cause associate
    components to hit and rattle. The axial play that facilitates the rattle is
    found on the helical gears and the splined shaft bearing. Replacing the helical
    gear components is expensive and the gears will wear again and the rattle will
    return. Removing the splined shaft bearing axial play significantly reduces the
    rattle to the point where it"s barely heard or not heard at all in the
    passenger compartment. Performance cams like the ones on this engine create
    stronger camshaft lash forces and thus are more susceptible to causing a
    rattle.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Another component that addresses the rattle is the diaphragm
    spring that"s incorporated in the intake sprocket. This spring loads the
    sprocket rotational movement to dampen the rattle quick movements.<br>
    Over time the diaphragm spring weakens and degrades in function. Replacing the
    diaphragm spring with a new one is often needed to fully resolve the rattle.<br>
    This diaphragm spring is not available as a separate part for the Euro S50
    engines. But fortunately the same diaphragm spring is also used on the S54 and
    S62 engines and is available separately for these engines. On the S54 engine the
    part number is 11-36-7-830-684. On the S62 engine the part number is 11-36-7-833-218.
    But with the S62 engine BMW redesigned the diaphragm spring to thicken it. This
    part is more effective and lasts longer.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>For an in depth discussion of the rattle cause and solution reference
    the Beisan single and double rattle procedure and single diaphragm spring procedure
    introductions.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The splined shaft bearing is made of a thick washer and two
    thrust (roller) bearings. The washer incorporates a stud that"s mounted to the
    vanos piston. The two thrust bearings sandwich the washer facilitating the splined
    shaft to rotate at camshaft speed without rotating the vanos piston. The washer
    and two thrust bearings are incased in a ring and two outer flat washers. The
    complete bearing is housed inside a splined shaft cavity and is closed off with
    a threaded cover.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Removing the splined shaft bearing axial play requires
    modifying or replacing one or more bearing components. The thrust bearings are
    a standard part and are manufactured to tight tolerances. It"s not feasible to
    modify or replace them. The center washer is also manufactured to a tight
    tolerance. The ring is a non-standard part and is manufactured to loose
    tolerance. It"s also made of standard steel that is annealed (soft). This is
    causing it to be scored by the center washer and thrust bearings. The outer flat
    washers reside inside the ring and thus influence the bearing axial fit. The
    washers are a standard bearing part, but due to their stamped manufacturing
    have a notable tolerance range which can significantly affect the bearing axial
    fit.<br>
    The ring can be replaced with a ring made of bearing steel that"s hardened and
    ground to bearing standards. Its height can be tightly controlled to provide a
    tight bearing axial fit. Standard bearing washers that have been measured and
    sorted can be combined to provide the needed height to provide a tight bearing
    axial fit. A bearing adjustment can be made at installation to address any
    minor axial fit variation.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The vanos rattle repair kit includes a replacement bearing
    ring and two outer washers.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Opening the splined shaft to modify the bearing requires
    counter holding the splined shaft and unscrewing the cover. The splined shaft
    doesn"t have a built in area for grabbing it, and the cover only has two holes in
    it to manipulate it. The cover threads also have high strength thread locker
    which makes the cover very difficult to remove.<br>
    A splined shaft holder tool is needed to receive and hold the splined shaft,
    and a socket tool with dowels is needed to insert into the holes in the splined
    shaft cover and open and close it.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The vanos rattle tools includes a splined shaft holder and
    splined shaft socket. The holder is square and mounts in a vise and receives
    and counter holds the splined shaft. The socket is a standard 1/2" drive size
    and has dowels that mount into the splined shaft cover holes to open and close
    the cover. The socket is designed to be used with an impact wrench to overcome
    the cover thread locker. The socket is also used with a torque wrench for final
    tightening.<br>

    Inspect splined shaft bearing axial play.<br>
    Hold splined shaft and rotate splined shaft stud to note resistance to
    rotation.<br>
    Hold splined shaft and tilt (rock) splined shaft stud to each side to note
    bearing axial play (free space).<br>
    Note: Axial fit cannot be properly assessed until splined shaft cover is fully
    tightened.<br>
    Note: Radial play, side to side movement, is normal and necessary. This should
    not be confused with axial play, in/out movement.<br>
    <br>
    If splined shaft stud binds and is difficult to rotate then axial fit it too
    tight and loosening adjustment is needed.<br>
    If splined shaft stud has any tilt movement then axial play is present and
    tightening adjustment is needed.<br>
    Any level of resistance (pre-load), without binding, in splined shaft stud rotation
    indicates no axial play and is considered an optimal fit.</p>

    Bearing loosening adjustment.<br>
    If splined shaft binds and is difficult to rotate then axial fit it too tight
    and loosening adjustment is needed.<br>
    Disassemble splined shaft bearing per above procedure.<br>
    Place sandpaper (300-400 grit) on flat table top. Place bearing outer washer on
    sandpaper.<br>
    Slide washer side to side on sandpaper ~6" back and forth while moderately
    pressing washer on sandpaper. Perform sanding for 10 seconds.<br>
    Rotate washer 90 degrees and repeat sanding process.<br>
    Flip washer to opposite side and repeat above sanding procedure; 10 seconds
    sanding, rotate 90 degrees, 10 seconds sanding.<br>
    Clean washer (brake cleaner &amp; towels).<br>
    Repeat washer sanding for second outer washer.<br>
    Reassemble splined shaft bearing per above procedure and reassess bearing axial
    fit.<br>
    Note: Washers are made from hardened steel and do not easily wear. Sanding
    procedure will remove ~.0025mm washer height, total ~.005. Washers might need
    max .015mm height adjustment.</p>

    Bearing tightening adjustment.<br>
    If splined shaft has any tilt movement then axial play is present and
    tightening adjustment is needed.<br>
    Disassemble splined shaft bearing per above procedure.<br>
    Place sandpaper (300-400 grit) on flat table top. Place bearing ring on
    sandpaper.<br>
    Slide ring side to side on sandpaper ~6" back and forth while moderately
    pressing ring on sandpaper. Perform sanding for 5 seconds.<br>
    Rotate ring 90 degrees and repeat sanding process.<br>
    Flip ring to opposite side and repeat above sanding procedure; 5 seconds
    sanding, rotate 90 degrees, 5 seconds sanding.<br>
    Clean ring (brake cleaner &amp; towels).<br>
    Reassemble splined shaft bearing per above procedure and reassess bearing axial
    fit.<br>
    Note: Ring is made from hardened steel and does not easily wear. Sanding
    procedure will remove ~.005mm ring height. Ring might need max .015mm height
    adjustment.</p>

    Once splined shaft bearing fit is assessed, and if needed adjustment performed,
    thread locker needs to be applied to splined shaft cover.<br>
    Remove splined shaft cover from splined shaft per above procedure.<br>
    Apply thread locker at middle of threads along perimeter of cover (high
    strength thread locker).<br>
    Reinstall splined shaft cover and fully tighten per above instructions.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Reinstall splined shaft stud O-ring.<br>
    Insert O-ring on splined shaft stud and roll O-ring down stud and drop into
    groove (fingers).<br>

    Turn crankshaft pulley clockwise for two revolutions (crankshaft turning socket
    / 1/2" long-arm ratchet).<br>
    If crankshaft binds and can"t be turned this is due to valve/piston
    interference and indicates timing is set wrong.<br>
    <br>
    Turn crankshaft pulley clockwise until cylinder 1 intake and exhaust cams point
    to each other at ~45 degree angle (crankshaft turning socket / 1/2" long-arm
    ratchet).<br>
    Note: Turning crankshaft counter clockwise is acceptable.</p>
  <p><img border=0 width=512 height=384

    Inspect TDC (top dead center) timing marks on engine timing cover and
    crankshaft harmonic balancer at ~11 o"clock position (mirror).<br>
    Adjust crankshaft pulley to align TDC timing marks (crankshaft turning socket /
    1/2" long-arm ratchet).<br>
    Note: Align pointer on timing cover with 1 mark on harmonic balancer.<br>
    Note: If timing marks on harmonic balancer not visible they might be hidden
    behind water pump pulley. Turn crankshaft pulley counter clockwise.<br>
    Note: Precise alignment is not necessary.</p>

    Fully retard intake camshaft timing.<br>
    Place open wrench (24mm combo wrench) on intake camshaft hex at front of
    camshaft.<br>
    Rotate intake camshaft counter clockwise to adjustment end position. If
    camshaft resistant to rotation rock camshaft back and forth to release seize.<br>
    Note: Rotating camshaft is most effective when standing at exhaust side of car.<br>
    Camshaft groove on first guide bearing will be roughly aligned with groove on
    first bearing cover (picture).<br>
    <br>
    If intake or exhaust camshaft timing grooves do not align within small
    deviation then engine timing it set wrong.<br>
