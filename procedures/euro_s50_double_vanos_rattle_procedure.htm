  <p>"Vanos" is BMW"s name for its variable valve timing units.
    Vanos units take on various shapes and design according to car year and model
    (engine model). The vanos discussed here is BMW part # 11-36-1-404-701. It"s a double
    vanos; meaning the intake and exhaust valve timing is varied. This vanos unit
    is part of BMW 6-cylinder engine Euro S50B32. This engine was incorporated into
    three car models, the 3-series Euro E36 M3 93-95, Euro Z3 M Coupe 98-00, and
    Euro Z3 M Roadster 96-00.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>This vanos, like most vanos designs, can develop a rattle.
    The vanos rattle is caused by wear in the variable valve timing helical
    (slanted) gears. These gears are found on the camshaft sprocket and splined
    shaft, which attaches to the vanos. The helical gear wear allows the camshaft
    to have lash movements that engage the splined shaft axially. At certain RPMs
    these movements resonate and engage axial play (free space) and cause associate
    components to hit and rattle. The axial play that facilitates the rattle is
    found on the helical gears and the splined shaft bearing. Replacing the helical
    gear components is expensive and the gears will wear again and the rattle will
    return. Removing the splined shaft bearing axial play significantly reduces the
    rattle to the point where it"s barely heard or not heard at all in the
    passenger compartment. Performance cams like the ones on this engine create
    stronger camshaft lash forces and thus are more susceptible to causing a
    rattle.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Another component that addresses the rattle is the diaphragm
    spring that"s incorporated in the intake and exhaust sprockets. This spring
    loads the sprocket rotational movement to dampen the rattle quick movements.<br>
    Over time the diaphragm spring weakens and degrades in function. Replacing the
    diaphragm spring with a new is often needed to fully resolve the rattle.<br>
    This diaphragm spring is not available as a separate part for the Euro S50
    engines. But fortunately the same diaphragm spring is also used on the S54 and
    S62 engines and is available separately for these engines. On the S54 engine
    the part number is 11-36-7-830-684. On the S62 engine the part number is 11-36-7-833-218.
    But with the S62 engine BMW redesigned the diaphragm spring to thicken it. This
    part is more effective and lasts longer.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>For an in depth discussion of the rattle cause and solution reference
    the Beisan single and double rattle procedure and single diaphragm spring
    procedure introductions.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The splined shaft bearing is made of a thick washer and two
    thrust (roller) bearings. The washer incorporates a stud that"s mounted to the
    vanos piston. The two thrust bearings sandwich the washer facilitating the
    splined shaft to rotate at camshaft speed without rotating the vanos piston.
    The washer and two thrust bearings are incased in a ring and two outer flat
    washers. The complete bearing is housed inside a splined shaft cavity and is
    closed off with a threaded cover.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Removing the splined shaft bearing axial play requires
    modifying or replacing one or more bearing components. The thrust bearings are
    a standard part and are manufactured to tight tolerances. It"s not feasible to
    modify or replace them. The center washer is also manufactured to a tight
    tolerance. The ring is a non-standard part and is manufactured to loose
    tolerance. It"s also made of standard steel that is annealed (soft). This is
    causing it to be scored by the center washer and thrust bearings. The outer flat
    washers reside inside the ring and thus influence the bearing axial fit. The
    washers are a standard bearing part, but due to their stamped manufacturing
    have a notable tolerance range which can significantly affect the bearing axial
    fit.<br>
    The ring can be replaced with a ring made of bearing steel that"s hardened and
    ground to bearing standards. Its height can be tightly controlled to provide a
    tight bearing axial fit. Standard bearing washers that have been measured and
    sorted can be combined to provide the needed height to provide a tight bearing
    axial fit. A bearing adjustment can be made at installation to address any
    minor axial fit variation.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The vanos rattle repair kit includes two sets of replacement
    bearing ring and two outer washers.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Opening the splined shaft to modify the bearing requires
    counter holding the splined shaft and unscrewing the cover. The splined shaft
    doesn"t have a built in area for grabbing it, and the cover only has two holes
    in it to manipulate it. The cover threads also have high strength thread locker
    which makes the cover very difficult to remove.<br>
    A splined shaft holder tool is needed to receive and hold the splined shaft,
    and a socket tool with dowels is needed to insert into the holes in the splined
    shaft cover and open and close it.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The vanos rattle tools includes a splined shaft holder and
    splined shaft socket. The holder is square and mounts in a vise and receives
    and counter holds the splined shaft. The socket is a standard 1/2" drive size
    and has dowels that mount into the splined shaft cover holes to open and close
    the cover. The socket is designed to be used with an impact wrench to overcome
    the cover thread locker. The socket is also used with a torque wrench for final
    tightening.<br>

    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Vanos rattle at a certain RPM range, often 1800-2200 RPM.
    Rattle can also occur at idle.<br>
