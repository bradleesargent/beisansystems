    <br>
  </p>
  <p>"Vanos" is BMW"s name for its variable valve timing units.
    Vanos units take on various shapes and design according to car year and model
    (engine model). The vanos discussed here is BMW part # 11-36-7-838-161. It"s a double
    vanos, meaning both the intake and exhaust valve timing is varied. This vanos
    unit is part of BMW 6-cylinder engine S54. This engine is incorporated into the
    M3 E46 00-06, Z3 E36 M Roadster &amp; M Coup 00-02, Z4 E85 M3.2 Roadster 05-08,
    Z4 E86 M3.2 Coup 06-08.<br>
    <br>
    This vanos experiences multiple failures and related failures. A major chronic failure
    is the breakage of the exhaust camshaft sprocket hub vanos oil pump driver
    tabs. There are two tabs and one or both can break.<br>
    <br>
    This vanos, as with other performance engine vanos units, incorporates an oil
    pump to provide high oil pressure for the vanos function. The high oil pressure
    allows for quick and precise positioning of the vanos and engine timing. With
    this vanos the oil pump is driven by the exhaust camshaft. Due to the need to
    have the vanos exhaust piston positioned to the center of the camshaft, the oil
    pump driver is offset from the center. Thus two drivers 180 degrees apart are
    used to balance the drive. The vanos has an oil pump disk with two holes and
    the exhaust hub has two driver tabs that insert into the oil pump disk holes.<br>
    One or both of the driver tabs can break and cause vanos malfunction and engine
    fault codes. A broken tab can stay lodged in the vanos oil pump disk hole or it
    can drop to the oil pan. In rare cases the tab can engage the chain and
    sprockets and cause engine damage.<br>
    <br>
    The oil pump driver tab is breaking either from excessive rotational pressure
    force or rattling hitting force. Inspection of the vanos oil pump disk holes
    shows wall indentations in the rotational and counter rotational tab engagement
    positions. The counter rotational indentations indicate a rattling hitting
    movement. A dynamic hitting movement can also produce significantly higher
    forces than a pressure force.<br>
    <br>
    This oil pump driver design was first used on the Euro S50 double vanos/engine.
    But the Euro S50 double vanos rarely encounters a tab breakage. Comparison of
    the Euro S50 double vanos and S54 designs shows design changes made for the
    S54. The S54 exhaust hub driver tab is lengthened by 3mm with 2.5mm used for new
    large chamfers. Also the oil pump disk hole diameter is increased by .7mm.<br>
    It is evident these changes were made to ease the installation of the vanos to
    the engine head. During this installation the vanos oil pump disk holes need to
    be aligned with the exhaust hub driver tabs and the disk holes inserted onto
    the tabs. Introducing large chamfers on the tabs and increasing the disk hole
    diameter eases the installation.<br>
    The lengthening of the driver tab does not seem to cause any oil pump
    performance changes. The new oil pump disk holes are deep enough to accommodate
    the extra length and this extra length is mostly a chamfer and thus does not
    engage the hole wall.<br>
    But the disk hole diameter increase can significantly affect the driver tab
    hitting issue. The Euro S50 double vanos oil pump disk hole diameter is 10.00mm
    and the tab width is 9.60. This provides .40mm tab to hole side play. The S54
    vanos oil pump disk hole diameter is 10.70mm and the tab width is 9.70mm. This
    provides 1.00mm tab to hole side play. This constitutes a two and a half multiple
    increase in tab to hole play from the Euro S50 design. This significant
    increase in free space can facilitate much higher hitting forces and thus is likely
    the cause of the tab breakage.<br>
    A comparison of the Euro S50 double vanos and S54 vanos oil pump disk hole
    indentations shows the S54 can encounter notably deeper indentations in the oil
    pump rotational direction. The hole indentations cause to increase the tab to
    hole play and thus can further increase the tab hitting force. S54 cars that
    encounter the tab breakage usually show significant oil pump disk hole
    indentations in the rotational direction.<br>
    <br>
    BMW has been engaged regarding vanos problems in the past and has elected to
    not address the issues, "No further development will be done". New (rebuilt)
    vanos units are being sold with the same oil pump disks with the same large
    diameter holes. BMW does not provide the vanos oil pump disk as a separate
    part.<br>
    <br>
    If the above hypothesis is correct, the simple answer to the tab breakage problem
    is to reduce the oil pump disk hole diameters. There are three potential
    approaches to accomplishing this. First, a sleeve can be inserted into the hole
    to reduce its diameter. In practice this has not worked well as the sleeve is
    indented into the existing hole indentations and the sleeve could crack due to
    this. Second, a new disk can be made. Metallurgical inspection of the disk
    center bushing indicates it is molecularly fused to the disk. This is a very
    special technique used by automotive manufacturers for camshaft and crankshaft
    bearings and is only made exclusively by a few companies in the world for auto
    manufacturers. The bushing is only .5mm thick and thus can"t be replaced with a
    pressed in bushing without thickening it and changing other design aspects of
    the disk which make the approach non-viable. Third, new holes can be drilled in
    the disk at a 90 degree offset form the existing holes. The holes must be
    precisely 180 degrees from each other and precisely the same diameter for both
    driver tabs to engage the hole sides simultaneously.<br>
    <br>
    A vanos oil pump disk with newly driller smaller holes can be acquired through
    Beisan Systems (bee-saan), <a href="http://www.beisansystems.com/products">www.beisansystems.com/products</a>.
    The disk hole diameter is 9.80mm. This leaves .10mm play between the driver tab
    and hole sides and is a further decrease from the Euro S50 double vanos .40mm play.
    This play reduction is intended to eliminate the occasional tab breakage that
    occurs on the Euro S50 double vanos. It might also resolve the occasional oil
    pump seize and damage that can occur.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>This vanos piston seals and static seal O-rings, other than
    the small O-ring on the oil pressure restrictor, are made of the correct
    materials and don"t experience premature failure. However over time and use the
    piston seal O-rings will experience notable compression set (flattening) and
    the Teflon rings will experience wear (loss of material). This can lead to
    degradation in performance. The static seal O-rings will also experience
    notable compression set and could eventually leak. Thus there is a need for a replacement
    seals solution for this vanos.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>A vanos seals/O-rings repair kit can be acquired through
    Beisan Systems (bee-saan), <a href="http://www.beisansystems.com/products">www.beisansystems.com/products</a>.
    It includes a vanos replacement set of OEM equivalent material Teflon rings and
    Viton O-rings.<br>
    <br>

  <p>The following repair procedure also covers the installation
    of the Beisan S54 vanos sealing plate repair kit and rebuilt vanos solenoid
    coil pack. Discussion of these products and the associate failure modes is found
    in the Beisan S54 vanos solenoid procedure, <a
href="http://www.beisansystems.com/procedures/s54_vanos_solenoid_procedure.htm">S54
    Vanos Solenoid Procedure</a><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Symptoms</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Fault codes:<br>
    <br>
    P0010 (BMW xx, 0xxx): Vanos intake solenoid circuit<br>
    P0011 (BMW 67, 0x43): Vanos intake timing over advanced<br>
    P0012 (BMW 72, 0x48): Vanos intake timing over retarded<br>
    Pxxxx (BMW 184, 0xB8): Vanos intake position control<br>
    P1525 (BMW xx, 0xxx): Vanos intake solenoid open circuit<br>
    <br>
    P0013 (BMW xx, 0xxx): Vanos exhaust solenoid circuit<br>
    P0014 (BMW 22, 0x16): Vanos exhaust timing over advanced<br>
    P0015 (BMW 21, 015): Vanos exhaust timing over retarded<br>
    Pxxxx (BMW 185, 0xB9): Vanos exhaust position control<br>
    P1531 (BMW xx, 0xxx): Vanos exhaust solenoid open circuit<br>
    <br>
    The generation of one of these codes will cause the DME to not utilize the
    vanos. Unfortunately the engine timing is left in the same position as when the
    failure occurred. Thus the engine will likely behave better at low RPM and
    worse at high RPM, or worse at low RPM and better at high RPM. Engine misfire
    with fault codes can also occur.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Diagnosis</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>If a circuit code is present the solenoid coil pack is
    likely failed. <br>
    <br>
    The above codes, other than the circuit codes, can occur when the vanos oil
    pump driver tab(s) breaks or the vanos solenoid coil pack fails. Thus an effort
    must be taken to distinguish between the two failures.<br>
    <br>
    A simple, but not conclusive, method of differentiating between the two
    failures is to reset the fault codes and start the engine and allow it to idle.
    If the oil pump driver tabs are broken the fault codes and check engine light
    will be generated in a few minutes. The solenoid coil pack failure is often
    intermittent and will take some driving before the fault codes and check engine
    light appear.<br>
    Unfortunately, there are cases where the solenoid coil pack can be
    significantly failed and the fault codes and check engine light appear at idle
    after reset. Further in some cases only one of the oil pump driver tabs will
    break. In such a case the fault codes and check engine light will not appear at
    idle and some driving will be necessary for them to appear.<br>
    <br>
    A definitive method of assessing which of the two failures exists is to remove
    the valve cover and inspect the oil pump driver tabs. If one or both are broken
    then that is the source of the problem. If they are present then the problem is
    most likely the solenoid coil pack.<b><br>

  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Repair Procedure</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The following is an E46 M3 vanos oil pump disk, sealing
    plate rings, vanos seals, solenoid coil pack, R&amp;R (remove and replace) procedure.<br>
    <br>
    Repair time: 5 hours mechanic, 7+ hours DIY.<br>
    <br>
    Valve adjustment repair can be combined with this repair. But only perform
    valve adjustment repair while vanos is fully mounted on engine head.<br>
    Thus perform valve adjustment repair just before removing vanos or just after
    installing vanos. This is referenced in the procedure.<br>
