    Remove two rivets at each end of air duct.<br>
    Remove center screw (medium Philips).<br>
    Pry out rivet base (tack lifter).<br>
    Note: Press in on screw while threading out. Change to a larger Philips head if
    necessary. If center screw does not unthread, pry out rivet and attempt to
    break (tack lifter). Replace rivet.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="e36_fan_procedure_files/image003.jpg"><br>
    Pull rear air duct out of alternator air duct and bend down and raise above retaining
    bridge.<br>
    <br>
    Lift up air duct from rear and remove from car frame.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384

  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="e36_fan_procedure_files/image005.jpg"><br>
    Unscrew overflow hose clamp at radiator right top (Philips).<br>
    Pry hose off radiator overflow neck (flathead).<br>
    Remove hose clamp from hose to keep from loosing.<br>
    <br>
    Note: If overflow hose clamp original, pry open clamp to remove (small flathead)
    and replaced with adjustable hose clamp.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384

  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="e36_fan_procedure_files/image007.jpg"><br>
    Remove rivet at each top corner of fan shroud. Pry out rivet center pin (tack
    lifter), then fully pry out rivet from base (tack lifter).</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="e36_fan_procedure_files/image008.jpg"><br>
    Insert hose onto radiator overflow neck and clamp opposite hose end (vacuum
    hose, clamp)<br>
    Note: This will prevent coolant leak when removing fan shroud.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="e36_fan_procedure_files/image009.jpg"><br>
    Remove fan, belt static friction method.<br>
    Remove fan / fan clutch from water pump shaft.<br>
    Place open wrench on fan clutch nut (32mm combo wrench). <u>Place wrench
    forward on nut to avoid hitting vanos body and radiator hose clamps</u>.
    Strongly strike wrench side at top with heavy hammer to break nut seize (sledge
    hammer); <u>left hand thread</u>.<br>
    Note: Nut is <u>left hand thread</u>, thus unscrew by hitting wrench top from
    left to right (car front orientation). Serpentine belt static friction on water
    pump pulley facilitates large enough opposing force to break nut seize. It is
    important to use a heavy hammer to produce a high instantaneous jerk. Several
    attempts will be needed before nut seize breaks. Rotate open wrench to
    reposition for better access.<br>
    <br>
    If belt static friction method is not successful, attempt pulley holding tool
    method.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384

  <p><img width=512 height=384
src="e36_fan_procedure_files/image011.jpg"><br>
    Remove fan, pulley holding tool method.<br>
    Remove fan / fan clutch from water pump shaft.<br>
    Position water pump pulley for holding tool access. Water pump pulley has 2
    (adjacent) pairs of mounting bolts. Position one of the bolt pairs with left
    bolt at just to right of top center (picture) (32mm combo wrench).<br>
    Install water pump pulley holding tool onto pulley bolts. Position holding tool
    at right, and place tool indent curve against fan clutch nut. Mount tool end
    hole onto pulley bottom left bolt, and tool second hole onto pulley right bolt.
    Reposition fan clutch nut for better holding tool access (picture).<br>
    Place open wrench on fan clutch nut (32mm combo wrench). Counter hold holding
    tool and break clutch nut seize (32mm combo wrench); <u>left hand thread</u>.<br>
    Note: Nut is <u>left hand thread</u>, thus unscrew by turning wrench from left
    to right (car front orientation).<br>
    <br>
    If fan clutch nut seize difficult to break, apply lubricant to nut/threads
    contact surfaces (spray lubricant).<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Once nut seize is broken, remove tools and spin fan blades
    to unscrew nut; <u>left hand thread</u>.<br>
    When nut is close to shaft end, turn fan slowly while continuously holding fan
    blades. This will keep fan from falling and damaging radiator fins when fully disconnected.</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384
