  <p>"Vanos" is BMW's name for its variable valve timing units.
    Vanos units take on various shapes and design according to car year and model
    (engine model). The vanos discussed here is BMW part # 11-36-1-440-142. It's a
    double vanos; meaning both the intake and exhaust valve timing is varied. This
    vanos unit is part of BMW 6-cylinder engines M52TU, M54, and M56. These engines
    were incorporated into a wide range of car models during years 1998-2006. They
    are found in the 3-series E46 98-05, 5-series E39 99-03 / E60 &amp; E61 02-05,
    7-series E38 98-01 / E65 &amp; E66 02-05, Z3 E36 98-02, Z4 E85 02-05, X3 E83
    03-06, X5 E53 00-06.<br>
    <br>
    This vanos, like most vanos designs, can develop a rattle. The vanos rattle is
    caused by wear in the variable valve timing helical (slanted) gears. These
    gears are found on the camshaft, camshaft sprocket, and splined shaft which
    attaches to the vanos. The helical gear wear allows the camshaft to have lash
    movements that engage the splined shaft axially. At certain RPMs these
    movements resonate and engage axial play (free space) and cause associated
    components to hit and rattle. The axial play that facilitates the rattle is
    found on the helical gears and the vanos piston bearing. Replacing the helical
    gear components is expensive and the gears will wear again and the rattle will
    return. Removing the vanos piston bearing axial play significantly reduces the
    rattle to the point where it's barely heard or not heard at all in the
    passenger compartment. Performance cams like the cams on the US E46 ZHP or
    aftermarket performance (Schrick) cams create stronger camshaft lash forces and
    thus are more susceptible to causing a rattle.<br>
    Beisan Systems provides a vanos rattle repair kit which has a replacement component
    for the vanos piston bearing to remove the bearing axial play. An associate
    special tool is also provided to facilitate the repair.<br>
    <br>
    Below is a more detailed explanation of the rattle cause and solution.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><u>Technical background</u><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>To understand the cause of the vanos rattle some
    understanding of the BMW variable valve timing system is needed.<br>
    <br>
    Variable valve timing is the modifying of the engine valve opening/closing
    timing dynamically. BMW's variable valve timing implements a time shift (phase
    shift) scheme. The camshaft cam is not modified, thus all the characteristics
    of the opening and closing of the valve remain the same. What changes is the
    time when the valve opening/closing occurs relative to the crankshaft timing.
    The camshaft relative rotational position to the crankshaft is modified
    (shifted). Advancing (clockwise) the camshaft advances (earlier) the valve
    timing (opening/closing) relative to the crankshaft. Retarding (counter
    clockwise) the camshaft retards (later) the valve timing (opening/closing)
    relative to the crankshaft.<br>
    Helical (slanted) gears are utilized to physically implement this mechanism.
    Due to their nature, helical gears require a rotation to insert onto each
    other. This characteristic of helical gears is utilized to implement the
    relative rotation of the camshaft to the crankshaft dynamically while the
    engine is running.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>[picture]<br>
    The camshaft and camshaft sprocket are not mounted directly to each other. The
    sprocket has a hole at its middle that's larger than the camshaft end. Opposing
    slant helical gears are mounted at the sprocket hole and camshaft end. There is
    an independent splined shaft with a cup and helical gears on the inside and
    outside of the cup walls. The splined shaft cup inner helical gears match the
    camshaft helical gears and the splined shaft cup outer helical gears match the
    sprocket helical gears. The splined shaft cup is inserted onto and mates with
    the camshaft and sprocket helical gears. Thus the splined shaft connects the
    camshaft and sprocket. Inserting and withdrawing the splined shaft axially
    in/out of the camshaft and sprocket requires the rotation of a component due to
    the helical gears. The sprocket rotation is fixed by the timing chain. The
    splined shaft can"t rotate due to the opposing helical gear slants on its cup
    inside and outside. Thus it's the camshaft that rotates when the splined shaft
    is manipulated axially.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>[picture]<br>
    Inserting the splined shaft axially onto the camshaft and sprocket causes the
    camshaft to advance (rotate clockwise) and cause advanced (earlier) timing.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>[picture]<br>
    Withdrawing the splined shaft axially from the camshaft and sprocket causes the
    camshaft to retard (rotate counter clockwise) and cause retarded (later)
    timing.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The vanos is a hydraulic actuator. Its function is to
    dynamically position the splined shaft axially to cause camshaft advance or
    retard rotation which enacts variable valve timing.<br>
    The vanos utilizes two cylinders and a piston. There is an oil chamber at the
    fore and aft of the piston. Controlling the oil pressure in the two oil
    chambers manipulates the axial position of the piston. Seals on the piston
    allow the piston to reciprocate axially along the cylinder walls while
    maintaining a tight oil seal on the two oil chamber. The splined shaft is
    mounted to the vanos piston. Thus manipulating the axial position of the piston
    also manipulates the axial position of the splined shaft. The piston has a
    bearing at its center. The splined shaft is mounted to this bearing. The piston
    bearing allows the splined shaft to rotate with the camshaft and sprocket while
    not rotating the piston.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><u>Cause of rattle<br>
    <br>
    </u></p>
  <p>Due to the nature of helical gears, not only does the axial
    positioning of the splined shaft cause the rotation of the camshaft, but also
    reciprocally the rotation of the camshaft causes the axial positioning of the
    splined shaft.<br>
    Over time and use the helical gears on the camshaft, sprocket, and splined
    shaft develop wear along the gear spline side contact surfaces. This wear
    creates excessive play between the helical gears. This causes excessive play in
    the fit of the splined shaft to the camshaft and sprocket. This manifests in
    axial play between the splined shaft and camshaft and sprocket.<br>
    As the camshaft rotates the cam nose rolls onto the valve seat and compresses the
    valve spring to open the valve and rolls off the valve seat and decompresses
    the valve spring to close the valve. The resistance force of the valve spring
    compression creates an opposing force to the forward rotation of the camshaft.
    The recoiling force of the valve spring decompression creates an additive force
    to the forward rotation of the camshaft.<br>
    Due to the splined shaft axial play, as the cam compresses the valve spring the
    camshaft will slightly retard in relative rotation to the crankshaft and as the
    cam decompresses the valve spring the camshaft will slightly advance in
    relative rotation to the crankshaft. These movements of the camshaft are due to
    camshaft least resistance path of movement. Due to the splined shaft axial play
    there is less resistance to the camshaft retarding than compressing the spring
    and less resistance to the camshaft advancing than containing the decompressing
    spring. These movements manifest into camshaft lashes which engage the splined
    shaft axially. The greater the helical gear wear the greater the splined shaft
    axial play the stronger the camshaft lashes.<br>
    At certain engine RPMs these camshaft movements resonate. This causes stronger
    camshaft lashes which cause more powerful engagements of the splined shaft
    axially. This causes strong axial movements of the splined shaft. Any axial
    play in the splined shaft vicinity is engaged and can cause a rattle.<br>
    There are two locations of axial play. The helical gears themselves have axial
    play that's engaged and rattles and the vanos piston bearing has axial play
    that's engaged and rattles.<br>
    <br>
    Testing has been performed to assess and attempt to reduce the rattling. The
    vanos piston bearing radial play was modified and the results indicated little
    to no change in the rattling. The vanos piston bearing axial play was increased
    and this resulted in a proportional increase in the rattling. The vanos piston
    bearing axial play was decreased and this resulted in a proportional decrease
    in rattling.<br>
    The testing results show that removing the vanos piston bearing axial play
    significantly reduces the rattling.<br>
    Some owners have had the dealership replace their helical gears (splined shaft,
    camshaft, sprocket) and this resolved all the rattle. These owners eventually
    developed the rattle again and to the same level as before. This is due to the
    new helical gears wearing and creating the splined shaft axial play.<br>
    <br>
    Engines with higher lift (performance) cams are more susceptible to having a
    vanos rattle, and the rattle is likely to be worse. The higher lift cams
    compress the valve springs further and thus cause higher spring forces. This
    causes stronger camshaft lashes which engage the splined shaft and axial play
    components harder.<br>
    This affects US 3-series E46 ZHP performance package cars and cars with
    aftermarket performance cams (Schrick)<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><u>Rattle solution<br>
    <br>
    </u></p>
  <p>As noted above removing the vanos piston bearing axial play
    significantly reduces the rattle. Also replacing the helical gear components
    (splined shaft, camshaft, sprocket) is expensive and the helical gears will
    wear again. Thus removing the vanos piston axial play is a practical approach
    to addressing the rattle problem. Furthermore, per bearing specification and
    consultation with bearings companies, there should be no bearing axial play and
    a notable axial pre-load (tightness) should be present.<br>
    <br>
    The vanos piston bearing is made of a thick washer and two thrust (roller)
    bearings. The washer if mounted to the splined shaft and the two thrust
    bearings sandwich the washer facilitating the washer to rotate at camshaft
    speed. The washer and two thrust bearings are incased in a ring and two ring
    outer washers. The complete bearing is housed inside a piston cavity and is
    closed off with a piston bolt/cap.<br>
    <br>
    Removing the bearing axial play requires modifying or replacing at least one
    bearing component. The thrust bearings are a standard part and are manufactured
    to tight tolerances. It's not feasible to modify or replace them. The ring and
    center washer are non standard parts and are manufactured to loose tolerances.
    The ring height can be reduced or the center washer height can be increased to
    remove the bearing axial play. The ring has been found to have a large height
    variation and the washer has been found to have a smaller height variation. Due
    to these findings, it's more effective to replace the ring. A bearing
    adjustment can be made at installation to address any minor axial fit
    variation.<br>
    <br>
    The bearing ring and center washer were assessed by a metallurgical consulting
    firm. The parts were assessed for their material makeup, hardness including
    micro depth hardness, manufacturing process and finish.<br>
    <br>
    As a solution to the vanos rattle problem a replacement vanos piston bearing
    ring is manufactured to the same specification as the original bearing ring but
    with a shorter height and a very tight height tolerance. The other ring
    dimensions are also manufactured to tight tolerances.<br>
    The bearing ring is a difficult and expensive component to manufacture. It's
    made from a special bearing steel and hardened to a high hardness. All its
    surfaces are ground. This technique allows for machining hard parts to a high
    dimensional tolerance and a polished surface.<br>
    <br>
    The double vanos rattle repair kit includes two replacement vanos piston
    bearing rings.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><u>Repair techniques<br>
    <br>
    </u></p>
  <p>To replace the piston bearing ring the piston bolt/cap that
    retains the bearing must be removed. This is difficult due to the need to
    counter hold the piston to open the bolt/cap and the small size of the piston.<br>
    <br>
    The piston has fins that allow for counter holding the piston to open the
    bolt/cap. But manufacturing a special tool for this purpose and providing it
    for a one time use is cost prohibitive. A vice can be used to counter hold the
    piston. A standard vise would damage the soft aluminum piston. Common aluminum
    and rubber coated aluminum vise jaw liners would also risk damaging the piston.
    Softer nylon vise jaw liners have been tested and found to hold the piston
    effectively without the risk of damaging it. Soft vise jaw liners are provided
    as an associate tool for the repair. The liners can also be useful for other
    delicate component work.<br>
    <br>
    Due to the small diameter of the piston the piston will spin in the vise jaws
    with soft vise jaw liners when attempting to remove or install the piston
    bolt/cap. An impact wench easily removes and installs the piston bolt/cap
    without risk of piston damage. Thus an impact wrench and impact socket is needed
    to perform the repair.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Symptoms</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Vanos rattle at a certain RPM range, often 1800-2200 RPM.
    Rattle can also occur at idle.<br>
    <br>
    This vanos is manufactured with loose piston bearings. Thus all vanos units can
    rattle. For the vanos to rattle a resonance needs to be achieved in the camshaft
    lash and associate parts movements. Some car models are more susceptible to
    achieving this resonance and rattle than others.<br>
    Models susceptible to experiencing vanos rattle:<br>
    3-series E46 320i, 323i, 330i<br>
    5-series E39 520i, 523i, 530i<br>
    5-series E60 530i<br>
    Z3 all models.<br>
    This list will be updates as more data is collected.<br>
    <br>
    Note: All models can and have experienced the vanos rattle.<br>

    Insert bearing bottom thrust (roller) bearing in piston bearing ring.<br>
    Note: Piston bearing top and bottom thrust bearings are interchangeable. Also
    thrust bearing faces are functionally same thus thrust bearing can be inserted
    in either orientation.</p>

    Insert bearing top washer on top of piston bearing ring.<br>
    Note: Washer faces are same thus washer can be inserted in either orientation.<br>
    Manipulate washer side to side while slightly pressing down to fully insert
    (fingers).</p>

    Install piston bolt/cap (hand).<br>
    Hand tighten bolt/cap.</p>
  <p><img border=0 width=512 height=384

    Strongly tighten vise onto piston shaft.<br>
    Note: Vise jaw liners are soft and will not damage piston surfaces.<br>
    <br>
    Fully tighten piston bearing bolt/cap (24mm impact socket 1/2" / 1/2" torque
    wrench).<br>
    If available, set impact wrench power to lowest setting.<br>
    Engage impact wrench in forward for 1 second interval 3 times to fully tighten
    bolt/cap.<br>
    Note: Do not press down on impact wrench. This will hinder holt/cap tightening.<br>
    Note: Piston will spin slightly in vise jaws. If piston excessively spins,
    further tighten vise jaws.<br>
    <br>
    Loosen vise jaws and remove piston from vise.<br>

    Install piston onto engine intake splined shaft with piston mounting bolt; <u>left
    hand thread</u> (T30 torx bit socket 1/4" / 1/4" ratchet &amp; extension).<br>
    Lightly tighten.</p>
  <p><img border=0 width=512 height=384

    Inspect piston bearing axial play.<br>
    Rotate piston to note resistance to rotation.<br>
    Hold splined shaft and tilt (rock) piston to each side to note bearing axial
    play (free space).<br>
    Note: Axial fit cannot be properly assessed until piston bolt/cap is fully
    tightened.<br>
    Note: Radial play, side to side movement, is normal and necessary. This should
    not be confused with axial play, in/out movement.<br>
    <br>
    If piston binds and cannot be rotated then axial fit it too tight and loosening
    adjustment is needed.<br>
    If piston has any tilt movement then axial play is present and tightening
    adjustment is needed.<br>
    Any level of resistance (pre-load) in piston rotation indicates no axial play
    and is considered an optimal fit.<br>
    <br>
    Note: US 3-series E46 ZHP performance package cars and cars with aftermarket
    performance cams (Schrick) must have no bearing axial play and bearing should have
    resistance to rotation (pre-load) to achieve optimal results.<br>

  <p>Remove piston and piston mounting bolt from intake splined
    shaft; <u>left hand thread</u> (T30 torx bit socket 1/4" / 1/4" ratchet &amp;
    extension).</p>

    Bearing loosening adjustment.<br>
    If splined shaft binds and cannot be rotated then axial fit it too tight and
    loosening adjustment is needed.<br>
    Disassemble piston bearing per above procedure.<br>
    Place sandpaper (~400 grade) on flat table top. Place bearing center washer on
    sandpaper.<br>
    Slide washer side to side on sandpaper ~6" back and forth while moderately
    pressing washer on sandpaper. Perform sanding for 10 seconds.<br>
    Rotate washer 90 degrees and repeat sanding process.<br>
    Flip washer to opposite side and repeat above sanding procedure; 10 seconds
    sanding, rotate 90 degrees, 10 seconds sanding.<br>
    Clean washer (brake cleaner &amp; towels).<br>
    Reassemble piston bearing per above procedure and reassess bearing axial fit.<br>
    Note: Washer is made from hardened steel and does not easily wear. Sanding
    procedure will remove ~.005mm washer height. Washer might need max .015mm
    height adjustment.</p>

    Bearing tightening adjustment.<br>
    If splined shaft has any tilt movement then axial play is present and
    tightening adjustment is needed.<br>
    Disassemble piston bearing per above procedure.<br>
    Place sandpaper (~400 grade) on flat table top. Place bearing ring on
    sandpaper.<br>
    Slide ring side to side on sandpaper ~6" back and forth while moderately
    pressing ring on sandpaper. Perform sanding for 10 seconds.<br>
    Rotate ring 90 degrees and repeat sanding process.<br>
    Flip ring to opposite side and repeat above sanding procedure; 10 seconds
    sanding, rotate 90 degrees, 10 seconds sanding.<br>
    Clean ring (brake cleaner &amp; towels).<br>
    Reassemble piston bearing per above procedure and reassess bearing axial fit.<br>
    Note: Ring is made from hardened steel and does not easily wear. Sanding
    procedure will remove ~.005mm ring height. Ring might need max .015mm height
    adjustment.<br>

    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Once piston bearing fit is assessed and adjustment is
    performed if needed, spray oil into bearing from both ends of piston/bearing
    (oil spray).<br>
    Rotate bearing to distribute oil (finger).<br>
    <br>
