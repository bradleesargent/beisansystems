    provided for reference purposes only and should be used at your own risk<br>

  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Introduction</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The E39 comes equipped with OEM Sachs struts/shocks,
    springs, and associated components. Sachs suggests the lifespan of their
    struts/shocks is 70k-120k miles. Sachs says cold weather and bad road
    conditions are the primary contributors to accelerated strut/shock
    deterioration. Sachs BMW struts and shocks are made in Germany. The Sachs parts BMW sells and the ones sold on the open market are identical, except for
    the part numbers. Sachs provides a lifetime (“defective or worn-out”) warranty
    on their struts/shocks. This is available through third party vendors, but not
    through BMW.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The following is a short discussion on rear shocks failure
    symptoms and diagnosis, and an E39 (not T) Sachs rear shocks R&amp;R (remove
    and replace) procedure.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Symptoms</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Initially, the rear shocks will squeak and have an extra
    bounce on speed bumps. Within a month this will transition to the car landing
    hard on speed bumps and the suspension feeling stiff on road bumps. A loss of
    control can also be felt during and after excessively bumpy road conditions.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Over time failing shocks can cause inner tire cupping and
    wear.<br>
    If the spring pads are badly worn, a clunk could be heard when landing from a
    speed bump.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>During turns/slaloms, the rear spring/shock can give way,
    causing the wheel to rise into the wheel well. The swing arm in turn will rise
    and push the wheel lower part out (negative camber). This scenario will give
    the feeling of swerve/tramline.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Diagnosis</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>There is no practical diy diagnosis for struts/shocks.
    Paying attention to the symptoms is sufficient to characterizing the failure.
    If one end of the car is presenting with failure symptoms, then it’s likely the
    other end is not far behind.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Repair Procedure</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The following is an E39 (not T) Sachs rear shocks R&amp;R
    (remove and replace) procedure.<br>
    A wheel alignment should be performed after the repair.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Repair time ~10 hours.<br>

    Place vertical separator between swing arm and car body. While pressing down on
    wheel hub (foot/leg), wedge in separator at swing arm front of axel (wood block).<br>
    Note: This step will serve to restrain wheel carrier / swing arm movement, and
    facilitate space for shock manipulation.<br>
    Note: Be careful not to scrape against underbody coating. Shorten wedge length
    as necessary to facilitate insertion without scrapping.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Coat both spring press spindle (bolt) threads with lubricant
    (graphite based grease). Also coat both spindle heads clasp contact surfaces.<br>
    Note: This is essential for proper function and maintenance of tool.<br>

  <p>Clean spring press clasps (coil seats) (brake cleaner /
    towels).</p>
  <p><img width=512 height=384

    Stand shock vertically on end.<br>
    Place spring press tail clasp on coil at bump stop top. Work clasp as far up
    spring/coil without jamming against a component.<br>
    Place spring press head clasp on coil, 5 coils down spring, keeping spindle
    strait on shock axis.<br>
    Tighten spindle to maintain clasps positions.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Perform same as above with second spring press, but placing
    first spring press tail clasp 180° down coil from first spring press tail clasp.<br>
    Spring presses should be on opposite sides of spring.</p>

    Note: It’s best to have shock horizontal when performing press process (floor
    pad or lap).<br>
    Tighten spindles (3/4” socket 1/2” / 1/2” ratchet | 3/4” combo wrench),
    rotating often between spindles. Maintaining proportional spindle clasp to
    clasp lengths is essential to keeping a spring press from sliding. Be careful
    not to jar spring presses.<br>
    Press process is complete when spring has some play between upper and lower
    seats, ~2” pressed.</p>

    Note: Picture shows shock after uncompressing is complete.<br>
    Once lower spring pad and spring bottom moderately seat onto shock lower seat
    (perch), align shock short bushing end middle with one of three bolts at shock
    mount top.<br>
    Rotate shock counter to spring coil downward spiral to maintain lower spring pad
    notch on spring end. Stop when perfectly aligned. If alignment position is
    overshot, continue turning shock and align with next bolt.</p>
