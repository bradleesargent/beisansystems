  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Introduction</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>"Vanos" is BMW"s name for its variable valve timing units.
    Vanos units take on various shapes and design according to car year and model
    (engine model). The vanos discussed here is BMW part # 11-31-1-402-428. It"s a single
    vanos; meaning only the intake valve timing is varied. This vanos unit is part
    of BMW 6-cylinder engine Euro S50B30. This engine was incorporated into one car
    model, the 3-series Euro E36 M3 93-95.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>This vanos has been experiencing a failure. It has been
    diagnosed that the failure is primarily due to deterioration of the vanos intake
    rod seal. It has been determined that this cup seal is made from Buna rubber (Buna-N,
    NBR, Nitrile). Buna is a very common rubber material, but is limited in its
    temperature and chemical resistance characteristics. Unfortunately it is
    fairing quite badly in the vanos/engine environment. The seal has been found to
    harden, shrink, and have flat surfaces. This deterioration is causing the seal to
    lose its functional characteristics and thus cause the vanos to fail. BMW has
    been engaged regarding other vanos failures in the past but has elected to not
    address the issues, "No further development will be done". BMW does not provide
    the vanos rod seal as a separate part.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The Buna rod seal can be replaced with a Viton rubber rod
    seal. Viton (FKM, Fluorocarbon) has similar functional characteristics to Buna,
    but has much higher temperature and chemical resistance characteristics. But an
    even better solution is to replace the rod seal with a Teflon equivalent.
    Teflon (PTFE filled) has a much lower friction property and is more appropriate
    for dynamic sealing than rubber. It"s compatible with the engine environment
    and is a standard material for this rod cup seal design. An O-ring is inserted
    in the cup to provide energizing support for the Teflon. The O-ring is best
    made from Viton to handle the engine environment.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The vanos intake piston seal can also in some cases
    experience a problem. This seal is made of a Teflon ring and a backing machined
    Viton rubber ring. It can lean to one side and the Teflon ring wears unevenly.
    This problem is caused by two factors. First, the rod seal failure causes
    leakage from an oil chamber on one side of the piston seal and the oil chamber
    on the opposite side of the piston seal presses against the seal and tilts it.
    Second, the piston seal cavity is too wide and facilitates the space for the
    seal to tilt. This is caused by the introduction of a paper gasket between two
    piston parts that widens the cavity. This paper gasket functions to maintain
    the piston parts from spinning during assembly, but has no function after
    assembly.<br>
    The piston seal problem can be solved by replacing the rod seal with a seal
    that doesn"t fail and allow the oil chamber leak, and the removal of the paper
    gasket to return the piston seal cavity to the correct width and remove the
    excess space.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The vanos solenoid O-rings also fail and in some cases and
    cause external oil leak. These O-rings are made from Buna and harden and
    flatten.<br>
    Replacing the O-rings with Viton O-rings has proven to not work. The Viton
    O-rings shred from the high oil pressure. BMW has redesigned the solenoid
    O-rings for the S62 engine (E39 M5) vanos unit. The S62 vanos solenoids are the
    same as the Euro S50 vanos solenoids and share the same O-rings. The new S62
    solenoid O-rings are not only made from Viton but also have multiple facets.
    These facets function to divert oil flow away from the O-ring and keep it from
    shredding.<br>
    The new S62 vanos solenoid O-rings are the correct design and can be used for
    this vanos solenoid O-rings. These are purchased directly from BMW and are not
    provided in the Beisan seals kit.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The vanos also has multiple O-rings used for static sealing.
    The O-rings, with the exception of one, are made from Viton, which is the
    correct material. But over time they experience compression set (flattening)
    and need replacement.<br>
    The static sealing O-rings can be replaced with a set of Viton O-rings.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>A vanos seals/O-rings repair kit can be acquired through
    Beisan Systems (bee-saan), <a href="http://www.beisansystems.com/products">www.beisansystems.com/products</a>.
    It includes a vanos replacement intake rod Teflon cup seal with inserted Viton
    O-ring, an intake piston seal of Teflon ring and machined Viton rubber ring,
    and a replacement set of the static Viton O-rings.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Symptoms</span></b><br>
    <br>
    Cars experience:<br>
    Overall loss of torque and power, particularly in the lower RPM range, &lt; 3k.
    Bogging then surging at 3k RPM. Uneven power distribution and RPM transition.
    Engine hesitations in the lower RPM range, &lt; 3k. Louder idle and
    intermittent idle RPM hiccups. Difficult takeoffs. Loss of power and bogging
    when AC on. Increased fuel consumption.<br>
    Repairing the vanos seals provides:<br>
    Overall increase in torque and power, particularly in the lower RPM range, &lt;
    3k. Resolution of bogging then surging at 3k RPM. Smooth even distribution of
    power and RPM transition. Resolution of engine hesitations in the lower RPM
    range, &lt; 3k. Quiet stable idle. Smooth easy takeoffs. Improved performance
    when AC on. Reduced fuel consumption.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Diagnosis</span></b><br>
    <br>
    In general, a diagnosis is not necessary. The vanos Buna intake rod seal
    deteriorates in 20k miles (32k kilometers). Thus essentially all the cars with
    this vanos have deteriorated intake rod seal and a failing vanos.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Repair Procedure</span></b><br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The following is a Euro E36 M3 single vanos seals R&amp;R
    (remove and replace) procedure.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>The valve cover gaskets and bolt grommets on the Euro S50
    engine are made from Viton and thus do not fail and need replacement.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Repair time: 5 hours mechanic, 7+ hours DIY.<br>

    Remove vanos intake piston mounting nut.<br>
    Initially loosen nut by counter holding splined shaft stud and unscrewing nut
    (7mm box wrench, 4mm socket (<u>6-point</u>) 1/4&quot; / 1/4&quot; ratchet).<br>
    Once nut is loosened, unscrew nut by counter holding nut and screwing splined
    shaft stud (7mm box wrench, 4mm socket (6 point) 1/4&quot; / 1/4&quot;
    ratchet).<br>
    When nut is close to end of shaft and shaft can no longer be held with tool,
    counter hold piston/shaft by hand and unscrew nut (fingers, 7mm box wrench).<br>
    Note: It is critical 6-point socket be used, as 12-point socket is susceptible
    to stripping shaft hex.<br>
    Note: Be sure to use wrench box end, as open wrench is susceptible stripping

    Rotate intake camshaft slightly clockwise (24mm open wrench).<br>
    Align intake timing grooves so camshaft bearing groove is slightly left of bearing
    cover groove (car rear orientation) (picture). If camshaft resistant to
    rotation rock camshaft back and forth to release seize.<br>
    Note: Rotating camshaft is most effective when standing at exhaust side of car.<br>
    Note: This step insures vanos intake piston/splined shaft stud do not protrude
    too far and obstruct mounting of vanos intake cylinder cover.</p>
  <p><img border=0 width=512 height=384
src="euro_s50_single_vanos_procedure_files/image127.jpg"><br>
    Inspect TDC (top dead center) timing marks on engine timing cover and
    crankshaft harmonic balancer at ~11 o"clock position (mirror).<br>
    If needed, adjust crankshaft pulley to align TDC timing marks (crankshaft
    turning socket / 1/2" long-arm ratchet).<br>
    Note: Precise alignment is not necessary.<br>
    <br>
    If crankshaft adjusted, double check and readjust camshafts timing as above.</p>
